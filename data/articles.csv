Israel says 'powerful strikes' coming in response to Iran firing missiles,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/benjamin-netanyahu-confirms-israel-iran-ceasefire/105455572,2025-06-24,"Israel's defence minister says the country's military will ""launch powerful strikes"" on Iran, accusing Iran of breaching a ceasefire between the two countries less than four hours after it was first declared — a charge Iran denies. Shortly before the announcement, Israel's government and military warned they had detected missile launches from Iran, heading towards the country's north. In a statement, Israel Katz said: ""I have instructed the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to respond forcefully to Iran's violation of the ceasefire with powerful strikes against regime targets in the heart of Tehran."" ""Tehran will tremble,"" Israel's Finance Minister Betzalel Smotrich wrote on X after the reported detection. Israel's defensive systems were working to intercept the missiles, the IDF said, warning residents in the country's north to stay in protected spaces until further notice. The Iranian military has denied firing on Israel, according to state media. However, several explosions boomed and sirens sounded across northern Israel after the breach was alleged. The potential ceasefire breakdown comes after US President Donald Trump said the two countries had agreed to pause their fighting. In a statement released earlier this afternoon, Mr Netanyahu's office said a meeting of Israel's security cabinet last night backed Mr Trump's proposal for a truce. Mr Netanyahu's office claimed Israel's ""Operation Rising Lion"" was a ""tremendous success"" and had achieved all of its objectives and more. ""Israel has removed a dual immediate existential threat — both in the nuclear and ballistic missile fields,"" it said. ""In addition, the IDF has achieved full air control over Tehran's skies, inflicted severe damage on the military leadership, and destroyed dozens of central Iranian government targets."" The statement added that in the past 24 hours, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had killed hundreds of Basij operatives and another nuclear scientist. ""In light of achieving the objectives of the operation, and in full coordination with President Trump, Israel has agreed to the president's proposal for a bilateral ceasefire,"" the statement said. ""Israel will respond forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire."" Earlier today, just after 8am AEST (6pm Washington time), Mr Trump announced that a ceasefire would begin at about 2pm AEST. ""It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE … for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED,"" he wrote on social media. He said 24 hours after the ceasefire began, an ""official end"" to the war would be ""saluted by the world"". Mr Netanyahu's statement is the first public response from Israel since Mr Trump's announcement. Iranian state television had earlier reported that the ceasefire went into effect. Iranian officials have not commented since Mr Trump's announcement. Hours before the ceasefire was due to take effect, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi praised the country's armed forces for responding to attacks right up to ""the very last minute"". Minutes earlier, he had posted on social media to say that Iran had made ""no 'agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations"". At about 3pm AEST, Mr Trump posted: ""THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!"" In the hours leading up to the ceasefire, Iran fired multiple waves of missiles into Israel. One strike killed four people in the country's south, Israel's ambulance service said."
Stranded Aussie travellers desperate for updates as flights cancelled,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/international-airport-passengers-stranded-doha-israel-iran-war/105453134,2025-06-24,"Stranded passengers have faced chaos and uncertainty while waiting for flights, either delayed or cancelled, due to the Middle East conflict. Routes to major cities across the worldhave already been cut off, including in Qatar's capital of Doha along with Dubai. Dubai Airports said operations had resumed after a brief suspension but is warning of further delays and cancellations, while Qatar's civil aviation authority said it had also reopened its airspace. Meanwhile, travellers in the air, in transit and waiting to board long-haul flightshave reached out to the ABC, desperate for clarityas conflicting information spreads online and in terminals. Some passengers reported being diverted mid-air, while others were stuck on the ground in limbo. By Tuesday afternoon, DFAT had not issued any updated advice since the airspace reopened. While the head of the Australian Travel Industry Association (ATIA) expected some flights to the gulf countries to be cancelled today, he said the worst thing travellers could do was cancel their own flights. ""That means you limit the number of things that an airline can … provide in terms of refunds,"" CEO Dean Long said. ""If [passengers] are flying out today or in the next 48 hours, they will be contacted by their travel agent or airline if their flight has been cancelled."" Mr Long said the most important thing was for travellers to stay calm. He said if they hadn't been contacted by their agent or airline within the next 24 hours, they should try to get in touch themselves. ""Be aware that their call centres are experiencing long delay times … we may not necessarily have the answer at this time,"" he said. Mr Long also said people should contact their travel agency about what sort of emergency accommodation is available to them. ""If they are nervous, book an extra night's accommodation where you are to give you that certainly that you will have a place to stay, and most of the time, you will be able to claim that with your travel insurance."" Compare Travel Insurance managing director Natalie Bell said passengers should also pay attention to Smartraveller and speak with their insurer about any concerns they have regarding their destination. ""Stay in contact with your booking agent or travel provider and make sure you know what options are available to you. Insurers will also typically assess claims on a case-by-case basis, taking individual circumstances into account, so get in touch if you have any queries,"" she said. Conflicting reports about cancellations and delays left many passengers at airports unsure of what to believe. An Adelaide nurse stranded at Doha's Hamad International Airport said the experience had been ""surreal"" after an air-strike hit a US military base about 50 kilometres from the terminal. Amanda Tate had just wrapped up a conference in Italy and was preparing to fly home when the incident unfolded. ""We started looking on the internet and seeing there had been some missiles launched. At that time we didn't know what had happened,"" she said. She found a quiet space in the airport and was huddled there with four others. ""We're like family now,"" she said. She described a tense atmosphere, with many travellers afraid to leave the airport. She said there were long queues at airline counters and little information about what was happening, or when flights would resume. ""He looked completely discombobulated. And another young girl was crying."" Polly Robertson was en route to Adelaide when her journey was disrupted by a sudden airspace closure, reportedly linked to restrictions imposed by the Qatari government. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast from Hamad International Airport, she described the confusion and frustration felt by many passengers. ""Everyone is literally sitting where they can find a spot and waiting for any of the announcements,"" she said. ""I flew in from Dublin and my flight was on the ground for 40 minutes. I was going through security when it happened. No announcements. Nothing."" She said travellers had received credit loaded onto their boarding passes but had heard nothing from airline staff. Damian Milverton, an Australian expat who travelled from Paris to Doha for work, was leading a workshop when Iranian rockets zipped overhead. ""It was initially a very large sound and then everyone was like, 'What was that?' We did not immediately think, 'dive under tables, we are under attack'. It was more a case of bewilderment,"" he told ABC News Breakfast."
Breaking down the confusion during the countdown to Trump's ceasefire,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/countdown-to-trump-ceasefire-confusion/105453114,2025-06-24,"US President Donald Trump created a lot of confusion when he announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. There was a long lag between Mr Trump's announcement — made via his social media platform Truth Social — and confirmation of the truce from leaders of the warring nations. The hours that followed his announcement were peppered with confusion and contradiction over when attacks might cease. Let's make sense of what happened. It depends on who you ask. Mr Trump said both sides had ""fully agreed"" to a ceasefire when he posted his statement at about 8am AEST. Iran's foreign minister posted an ambiguous statement about the ceasefire on X at 10.30am AEST. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed his government had agreed to a ceasefirein a statement after about 4pm AEST. There were conflicting accounts of what had been agreed to, and Mr Trump's vague language didn't help. He didn't use specific time references, instead using phrases such as ""six hours from now"" and ""upon the 12th hour"". Here's the full text of his post: Mr Trump's post also appeared to suggest a different ceasefire start time for Iran to Israel. There was a long lag between his post and confirmation from Iran or Israel. Mr Trump's announcement of the ceasefire came at about 8am AEST. But at about 10.30am AEST, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi's post on X appeared to contradict the US president. ""As of now, there is no 'agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,"" Mr Araghchi said. ""The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later. However, he did say Iran would stop its attacks if Israel stopped its air strikes by 4am local time, which was about 10.30am AEST. His next tweet didn't explicitly say Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, but appeared to indicate it had halted attacks. ""The military operations of our powerful Armed Forces to punish Israel for its aggression continued until the very last minute, at 4am,"" he said. Shortly after 2pm AEST, Iranian state television reported that a final barrage of missiles had been sent towards Israel. A few hours after Mr Trump's announcement, the Israeli military (IDF) said five waves of missiles were launched toward Israel from Iran. It said the last impact came shortly after the ceasefire was due to start, with Israel's emergency services reporting people killed on the ground. By this point, we still hadn't heard anything from Israel's government. It wasn't until about 4pm AEST that we got the statement from Mr Netanyahu's office saying Israel had agreed to a ceasefire. Then, about two hours later, Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, announced his country would launch attacks against Iran. ""I have instructed the IDF to respond forcefully to Iran's violation of the ceasefire with powerful strikes against regime targets in the heart of Tehran,"" Mr Katz said in a statement at about 6pm AEST. Mr Araghchi had said his government's decision on the cessation of military operations would be ""made later,"" but, as of 7pm AEST, he hadn't posted any further updates. According to US government officials, Mr Trump communicated directly with Mr Netanyahu to secure a ceasefire. It's unclear what role Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's leader, played in the talks. Reuters and the Associated Press said US Vice-President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and special envoy Steve Witkoff communicated with Iranians through direct and indirect channels. The US government maintained that its bombing of Iran on Saturday helped get Israel to agree to the ceasefire. It also said the Qatari government helped to broker the deal. Israel announced new attacks against Iran just two hours after it confirmed the ceasefire. Earlier in the day, Mr Trump told US broadcaster NBC the ceasefire would last ""forever"". ""I think the ceasefire is unlimited,"" he said. ""It's going to go forever."" That's unclear. Mr Trump appeared to suggest that Israel and Iran would first have some time to complete any missions currently underway, at which point the ceasefire would begin in a staged process. Here's what he wrote: ""There will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!"" he posted on Truth Social. ""Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World. During each CEASEFIRE, the other side will remain PEACEFUL and RESPECTFUL."" Mr Trump did not elaborate on the mechanics of the proposal or explain why his post suggested a delay between when the ceasefire would take effect in Iran and when it would take effect in Israel. Counterinsurgency expert David Kilcullen the lead-up to a ceasefire is when the most intense fighting occurs. ""We've seen repeatedly in the past that ceasefires can fall over at the last minute as each side tries to, you know, burnish its position leading into the end of hostilities,"" Mr Killcullen said. ""So I think there's a lot of things to still drop into place before we can say the ceasefire will happen."""
"As Trump celebrated a ceasefire, Iranian missiles killed Israelis",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/donald-trump-ceasefire-iran-israel-analysis/105452368,2025-06-24,"After America rained bunker-buster bombs on Iran's nuclear sites at the weekend, the big question was: How would Iran respond? The Islamic Republic promised heavy punishment. But with limited capabilities, few allies and incapacitated proxy fighters, there appeared to be few good options to deliver it. Less than 48 hours after the US strikes, we saw an Iranian response — a barrage of missiles fired at America's biggest base in the Middle East. According to Donald Trump, 14 missiles were launched at the Al Udeid base in Qatar, which ordinarily houses about 10,000 troops. Thirteen of the missiles were taken down by Qatari air defences, and one was allowed to fall out of the sky because it wasn't a threat. But the key detail is that Iran shared its attack plan before it acted on it, so the Qatari base could be cleared to prevent casualties. This meant the missile launch was more of a performance than an attack. No injuries, little damage. And the ball back in Trump's court. So then the big question became: How would Trump respond? He'd warned Iran against striking US bases. Tit-for-tat escalation was now a frightening possibility. ""There will be either peace or there will be tragedy for Iran,"" Trump had told Americans in his televised address on Saturday night. ""Remember, there are many targets left."" Would Trump follow through on his threat to strike those targets? Was this a sudden turning point towards a wider war? Trump's answer arrived, true to form, in a social media post. It was a ""thank you"" to Iran. ""I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured,"" Trump wrote. ""Perhaps Iran can now proceed to peace and harmony in the region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same."" Trump had never shown an appetite for a bloody battle with Iran. He'd spent weeks pressing its leaders to accept a no-nukes deal to prevent conflict. And after the nuclear facility strikes, he pushed the message it was ""mission accomplished"" — that diplomacy may have failed, but the nuclear threat was ""obliterated"" and the US was achieving, as he liked to say, ""peace through strength"". Trump's initial round of social media posting suggested he was willing to take what's been described as an ""off-ramp"" away from worsening hostilities. The deliberately benign nature of the attack on the base in Qatar appeared designed to de-escalate. It meant the US could leave Iran and Israel to continue trading blows themselves, free of the pressure to strike back that would have been created by American casualties. But then came another social post: Trump said Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. It would end what he had now named ""the 12 day war"". ""Perhaps Iran can now proceed to peace and harmony in the region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same."" His vice-president, JD Vance, told Fox News the deal must have been finalised while he was on his way to the cable network's Washington studios. Trump ""was working the phones as I was on the way over here,"" Vance told the network, and declared it was ""the beginning of something really big for peace in the Middle East"". On the same channel a little later, Republican senator Katie Britt went even further. ""Donald Trump is going to win the Nobel Peace Prize, no doubt,"" she said. ""He has brought peace to a region that needed stability."" But Israel wouldn't confirm the ceasefire agreement. Iran's foreign minister said there was no agreement, but that Iran would stop responding to Israeli aggression if Israel stopped the aggression. Just a couple of hours later, Israel said more missiles were being fired its way from Iran. Israelis sought shelter, but the national ambulance service later said several people had been killed. Around the same time, Trump was still celebrating on social media, predicting ""love, peace, and prosperity"" for both Israel and Iran. At the time of writing, it's not at all clear how concrete this agreement is. Even if the warring parties cease firing, the region's fate rests on some big unknowns. Trump, a frequent exaggerator, hasn't offered solid evidence to back his claim Iran's nuclear program is obliterated, and other officials have offered less certain assessments. Given all the forewarning before the bombings, there's also a high chance Iran's enriched uranium was moved away from the targeted facilities. The UN's nuclear watchdog says its whereabouts are unknown. Israel obviously won't be satisfied if it sees signs the enrichment program is revived. Then there's the ongoing assault on Gaza, where Israeli forces continue to kill Palestinians daily. In the past month, as the Iran-Israel war stole attention, hundreds of people in Gaza were apparently killed while seeking food from the new US-backed aid program. The official death toll in Gaza is approaching 56,000 — and may have even passed it. After an eventful day in the Middle East, America has been claiming some big wins. But there are also ongoing, devastating losses — and some big questions whose answers could easily change everything once again."
US congressmen on both sides urge Trump to continue AUKUS sub deal,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/us-congressmen-lobby-trump-administration-continue-aukus-deal/105455188,2025-06-24,"US politicians who have championed AUKUS have stepped up lobbying efforts with the Trump administration, saying the defence technology pact is ""critical"" to deterring ""Chinese aggression"" and urging the White House not to dump it. The Trump administration said earlier this month it would conduct a 30-day review of AUKUS, with US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth telling Congress last week his department would ""make sure it fits the priorities of the president and that our defence and shipbuilding industrial base can support."" The federal government has played down the impact of the review, saying it was confident the White House would continue to endorse the initiative. Five US congressmen who sit on multiple influential house defence committees have now written to the defense secretary to declare their support for AUKUS, saying it was a ""critical mission"" to ""deter Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific region."" The senior Pentagon official conducting the review, Elbridge Colby, has previously said the US will only be able to sell at least three Virginia-class nuclear submarines to Australia under AUKUSif it succeeds in rapidly lifting its rateof submarine production. Australia has committed $3 billion to help bolster America's submarine industrial base under AUKUS. The five congressmen — including Republican and House Armed Services Committee chair Mike Rogers as well as Democrats Joe Courtney and Adam Smith — said in their letter that they were ""confident in our ability to meet both US fleet requirements and our AUKUS commitments."" The politicians said additional funding commitments from Congress, on top of Australia's payments, have allowed US shipyards to ramp up steel fabrication and increase construction pace. ""Shipbuilders delivered two attack submarines in 2024 (USS New Jersey and USS Iowa), with two more slated for delivery in 2025 (USS Massachusetts and USS Idaho), and another two in 2026,"" they wrote. They argued that increasing capacity would ""open a pathway to selling the Virginia-class submarines to Australia in 2032, 2035, and 2038"", as planned. The congressmen also talked up progress on skills, saying ""over 120"" Australian sailors and officers were currently completing joint nuclear submarine training, with other Australian sailors already joint-crewing US Virginia-class submarines."" The letter comes as AUKUS supporters in both the Senate and Congress — as well as Australian officials — intensify efforts to reassure senior Trump administration officials that it should stand. Late last week, Democrat Senator Tim Kaine and Republican Senator Pete Rickettsintroduced a bipartisan billaimed at strengthening AUKUS by ""streamlining defence industrial base collaboration"" and exempting Australia and the UK from congressional notification for overseas manufacturing. Defence Minister Richard Marles discussed AUKUS during talks with his UK counterpart John Healy in London ahead of his visit to the NATO meeting in the Hague. He again said the review was a ""perfectly natural step"" for the Trump administration to take and expressed confidence in AUKUS, although he said he would not speculate on its outcome. Mr Marles also acknowledged that developing enough highly trained submariners, engineers, and specialists would be crucial to the success of AUKUS in Australia. ""We are confident that we can get this right, but we're not sanguine about it,"" he said."
Australia's 'fundamentally flawed' mental health plan needs to be thrown out: report,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/mental-health-and-suicide-agreement-flawed-productivity-report/105453974,2025-06-24,"Australia's national plan to improve mental health and prevent suicide is ""not fit for purpose"" and needs to be re-written, according to a new report by the Productivity Commission. The commission has been reviewing the National Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Agreement which sets out the shared commitments between the federal government and state and territory governments to improve the mental health of Australians. The commission has now released an interim report which revealed the national agreement was ""fundamentally flawed"" and made no real improvements to the mental health system since it was signed in 2022. The agreement aims to: It aims to meet these objective by funding services such as: Commissioner Angela Jackson said major change would be impossible under the current agreement as its outcomes, such as ""reforming the mental health system"" were too broad and not easily measurable. Australia is facing a mental health crisis as more people need care for more complex conditions but can't get the help they need due to workforce shortages and a lack of mental health beds in hospitals. Measures of mental health and suicide rates have not improved in recent years, according to the report. More troubling, the suicide rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people worsened between 2018 and 2023. Co-commissioner and Gungarri man Selwyn Button said there were a raft of initiatives that weren't connected to each other, thus creating a fragmented system, and early intervention to prevent suicide needed improving. ""There is still stigma attached with respect to having conversations with a clinician about suicide,"" he said. The commission said the agreement made certain commitments but didn't dedicate funding to achieve those aims. For example, it sets out a strategy to close the health gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but there was no specific funding allocated to do this. ""This really needs to be prioritised … and we have the expertise, we just need to get the right people at the table,"" Mr Button said. Dr Clinton Schultz, a Gamilaroi man and director of First Nations strategy at the Black Dog Institute said any national agreement needed to link research to the real world. ""We're generating strong evidence around what works – particularly in novel treatments — but there's still no mechanism to bring that innovation into the public system. Until we bridge these gaps, we'll keep seeing missed opportunities to support our mob in meaningful ways."" Ms Jackson said another key priority was getting funding for psychosocial support for people who don't qualify for the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). Psychosocial support is non-clinical help including connecting people with the right services and building daily living skills. Funding for that was withdrawn after the NDIS was introduced, which left around 500,000 people without support. ""Obviously the NDIS has led to significant change for people with disability but for those outside the scheme there's been a real reduction in supports and this is a matter of urgency,"" Ms Jackson said. The commission recommended the current agreement, which is due to expire in July 2026, be extended to 2027 to give the government time to create a new agreement that is co-designed with consumers, carers and service providers. ""The new agreement must have measurable outcomes and greater accountability … it's really important everyone understands what's improving and what's not,"" Ms Jackson said. Health Minister Mark Butler said the review highlighted structural issues with the agreement and it was ""essential we get this right"". ""That is why the treasurer, and I commissioned this review in the first place, to get independent advice to inform our next agreement,"" he said. Mr Butler said two weeks ago the state and territory health ministers agreed that psychosocial, workforce and youth mental health would be priorities in the next national agreement. The Productivity Commission is now accepting more public submissions before preparing a final report later this year."
"Most young people think Australia is a racist country, survey finds",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/survey-finds-significant-rise-in-racism-indigenous/105453342,2025-06-24,"Australia's only national survey tracking progress on reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians has recorded a near 40 per cent rise in racism during the past decade. The biennial Australian Reconciliation Barometer, conducted by Reconciliation Australia, has shown a ""significant"" jump in racism experienced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, from 39 per cent in 2014, to 54 per cent in 2024. Experiences of racism included verbal abuse, social media abuse, being refused entry or service, being prevented from renting a property, and physical violence, with younger First Nations people reporting higher levels of racism than other age groups. Racial discrimination was experienced at the hands of police, taxis and rideshare services, government services, hospitality and utility providers, and employers. Reconciliation Australia chief executive Karen Mundine said many factors were driving the ""disheartening"" increase in reports. ""I think probably people are more likely to report those experiences, and people have a greater understanding of what it is,"" she said. ""[That's] not just in an interpersonal way, but understanding the structural systems that also reinforce racist behaviours and outcomes that are discriminatory."" Ms Mundine said the increase in racism ""resonates with what we've heard anecdotally"" about the impact of the 2023 Voice referendum campaign on First Nations people. The survey showed the referendum also affected the way young people view Australia, with 61 per cent of 18-24-year-olds saying they believe it is a racist country, compared to 41 per cent of the general community. Of those young people, two-thirds said their view was influenced by ""the way people engaged with the Voice referendum campaign"". ""[They feel] it is another experience of racism and structural racism, and of the broader mainstream Australia not wanting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to have a voice and to be involved and to participate."" The director of the UTS Centre of Indigenous People and Work, Nareen Young, said the increase had been fuelled by ""bad behaviour"" on social media and a politically charged climate. ""The rise of right-wing populism, we know that it's been rejected by and large in Australia, but there's still pockets and they're active. I think that there's a lot of responsibility there,"" she said. The data showed young people and multicultural communities were more likely to be in favour of participating in the reconciliation process. Sixty-six per cent of young people and 56 per cent of multicultural Australians reported they want to do something to help reconciliation, compared to 42 per cent of the general population. Karen Mundine put that down to progress on teaching Australian history in schools. ""I think the difference is there's a growing number of young people who are better educated and better aware,"" she said. ""We've had curriculum that teaches Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, and particularly around those ideas of reconciliation relationships."" Truth-telling has strong support across the community, with 67 per cent of Anglo-Australians, 81 per cent of multicultural Australians and 89 per cent of young Australians saying they believe it was important. Karen Mundine said this should indicate to governments that community sentiment would back the implementation of truth-telling policies. ""There is strong support there for the idea of truth-telling, but also for participating in truth-telling,"" Ms Mundine said. ""Knowing where we've come from, knowing our histories, knowing the things that have gotten us to where we are today influences how we can actually make change today, but also create that change for a better future."" She said Reconciliation Australia would continue to lobby the federal government on meaningful Indigenous policy design when the 48th parliament returns next month. She also urged it to adopt the National Anti-Racism Framework, which waslaunched by the Australian Human Rights Commission last year. It made 63 recommendations for change, including an anti-racism taskforce, a national body to oversee the prevention of Aboriginal deaths in custody and an external review into racism in the criminal justice system. ""There is a role for governments to play there, a role for businesses to play, as we think about how we create a more just and cohesive society,"" Ms Mundine said. Nareen Young said there may also need to be further scrutiny of the legislation designed to address racism at work. ""I think we need to really start thinking about anti-racism in the workplace. That's failed to be implemented over the 50 years of the Race Discrimination Act,"" she said. ""The anti-racism framework contains elements that I really support … it's a brilliant framework. ""But I think we do need to examine workplaces and the effectiveness of the current legislative framework separately."" The survey included 532 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and 1,990 non-Indigenous people, with both samples weighted to be representative of the population."
"Social media ban won't mean all kids' accounts disappear, says commissioner",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/esafety-commissioner-tempers-expectations-social-media-ban/105454838,2025-06-24,"The commissioner tasked with overseeing the implementation of Australia's world-leading laws to get children and teenagers off social media says the ban is unlikely to catch all underage users immediately. While e-Safety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said she was confident work was on track to meet the December 10 deadline as planned, she also flagged that it was wrong to expect the ban would mean under-16s were immediately scrubbed from platforms when it came into force. ""This legislation does not give us a mandate to cut the Coral Cable or deplatform social media apps on stores,"" she told the National Press Club in Canberra on Tuesday. ""Nor should we create expectations that every child's social media account will magically disappear overnight."" In her address, she characterised the controversial laws as a social media ""delay"" rather than an outright ban, despite its blanket application for all Australians under the age of 16 — even if they already own an account or have parental consent. Communications Minister Anika Wells will determine what platforms will fall under the ban's umbrella, with TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook already named. On Tuesday, it was revealed the commissioner provided advice to Ms Wells statingYouTube should also be captured, despite the previous communications ministerinitially carving it out. The provided rationale was new research conducted by the eSafety Commission that found YouTube was the most common platform where young people experienced harm, which included viewing violent, misogynistic and dangerous content. A spokesperson for Ms Wells said she was carefully considering the commissioner's advice. ""Her top priority is making sure the draft rules fulfil the objective of the act — protecting children from the harms of social media,"" they said in a statement. Dr Inman Grant's task is to figure out how the laws will be implemented, including deciding on the ""reasonable steps"" social media companies will be expected to take and enforcing the laws, which include fines of up to $50 million for platforms that do not comply. There are no penalties for young people or parents who circumnavigate the rules. The guidelines given to social media companies, she said, would likely include what age assurance and privacy measures they needed to have in place and the ""level of proactive detection required by services to identify underage users"". It is so far unclear how exactly social media platforms will ascertain users' ages. The commissioner said it would likely involve a combination of age assurance methods — ""a waterfall of effective techniques and tools"" — rather than one mandated technology. A government-commissioned trial of available age assurance technology found last week that options existed toverify the ages of users ""privately, robustly and effectively"", but the preliminary report did not include any details of the specific tests nor how the 53 different technologies involved fared. ""There will be challenges with each one of them, but what the preliminary findings do say is that the technology is here and it's possible,"" the commissioner said. ""None is going to solve every use case, but again, we expect that companies will take layered approaches."" Shadow communications minister Melissa McIntosh called on the government to make it clear what it expected from social media platforms, including which ones were covered by the laws, with just months to go before the deadline. ""There are more questions than answers right now, including what verification technology will be required, which platforms are in or out and what constitutes platforms taking reasonable steps to implement social media age minimum standards by 10 December 2025,"" she said in a statement on Tuesday. The commissioner, who was to begin consultations this week, said there would be more clarity once the minister made her final determination of the rules. ""We may be building the plane a little bit as we're flying it … but I'm very confident we can get there,"" Dr Inman Grant said. While the commissioner conceded that there would be ways for young people to work around the bans, including through the use of VPNs, she said the goal was to change norms around social media use. ""We are not building a great Australian internet firewall, but we are seeking to protect under-16s from those unseen yet powerful forces in the form of harmful and deceptive design features that currently drive their engagement online,"" she said. ""For that reason, it may be more accurate to frame this as a social media delay."" The delay, she argued, would buy time to deliver improved online safety education to young people grappling with the rise of artificial intelligence, deepfakes, bullying and tailored algorithms. It would also, she said, shift the onus to manage young people's online access off parents and onto tech giants. ""This world-leading legislation seeks to shift the burden of reducing harm away from parents and carers and back onto the companies themselves — the companies who own and run these platforms and profit from Australian children,"" she said."
The winners and losers in this year's NSW budget,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/nsw-budget-winners-and-losers-2025-26/105448262,2025-06-24,
Complainant says Gareth Ward 'fixed us drinks' before alleged incident,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/gareth-ward-trial-complainant-drinks-alleged-assault/105456064,2025-06-24,"The second man to give evidence in the trial of NSW MP Gareth Ward has described how the politician ""fixed us drinks"" on the night of the alleged assault. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was 17 when he first met Mr Ward at an event in late 2012. In their opening, the Crown alleged Mr Ward indecently assaulted the man, then 18, at his Meroo Meadow home in 2013, including touching his buttocks and scrotum and mounting his back. The independent MP for Kiama and former Liberal minister has pleaded not guilty to charges involving the younger complainant, as well as additional charges, including sexual intercourse without consent, involving an older complainant. Mr Ward denies all allegations. After hearing evidence from the first complainant, the trial continued into its 16th day with testimony from the second. Giving evidence in the NSW District Court from a remote location, the younger complainant described how he met the MP thinking they had become ""mates"" and their association a ""friendship"". In February 2013, after a party where he had been drinking and there had been tension with his girlfriend, the complainant said he left feeling low and sat drinking alone. He told the court Mr Ward phoned him, expressed concern and offered to pay for a taxi to his house. Arriving at the Meroo Meadow property, the complainant said the atmosphere was noticeably different to previous gatherings. ""I remember being instantly taken aback by how different the vibe was compared to the last time I had been there with a lot of people,"" he said. The man said they sat at Mr Ward's kitchen bench drinking. ""He was fixing us drinks,"" he said, including what might have been coffee vodka, which was a ""fixture in his [Mr Ward's] freezer at the time"". The court heard they later moved outside, where the complainant jokingly pretended to pass out on the grass. The trial continues tomorrow, when the younger complainant is expected to give further evidence."
"'At least 33' potential buyers for the Whyalla steelworks, SA Premier says",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/overseas-options-among-interested-buyers-for-whyalla-steelworks/105452854,2025-06-24,"There are ""at least 33 interested parties"" to acquire the Whyalla steelworks, with a majority of them based overseas, SA Premier Peter Malinauskas says. Four months after tipping the steelworks into administration and removing GFG Alliance as its owners, the state government on Tuesday announced that a secure data room has been set up for prospective buyers to conduct due diligence on purchasing the steelworks and its associated mines. Steelworks administrators KordaMentha has previously said that there were up to 12 ""interested parties"" in the steelworks, but the Premier today revised that number up to ""at least 33"". Mr Malinauskas said more than 60 per cent of the prospective buyers were from overseas, including ""very significant global steelmakers with names that are synonymous with serious investment in the industry"". ""If you had said to me back in February — when we made that major intervention to remove GFG and put the steelworks on the path to new ownership — that we'd be in the position that we are in now, I would have taken it in a second,"" he said. ""We, of course, have got a long way to go before we are able to sell the steelworks to new ownership and set it up for the future. Mr Malinauskas did not name the global companies involved, but said the interest parties were from India, Japan and Korea. Australian company BlueScope Steel had also previously been linked to a potential takeover, with KordaMentha tapping the firm as a steelmaking adviser during the administration. South Korean steel giant POSCO has also been mooted as a potential buyer. The amount of interest in the steelworks has not changed the state government's expectations for when the steelworks will be sold, Mr Malinauskas said. The premier said a sale in the second half of 2026 ""probably looks about right"". It comes as the state government continues to pour money into the facility to keep it operating during administration. June's state budget revealed another $384 million had been set aside for KordaMentha to keep the steelworks running until it found a buyer — on top of an initial $384 million allocated when it took over the steelworks in February. The new $384 million may not be expended in full, and the state government said it expected it to be split 50-50 between the state and federal governments. Mr Malinauskas said the ""run rate of expenditure"" during the administration was ""going down"". The federal government is yet to commit to its half of the $384 million in administration funding earmarked for next financial year. Federal Industry Minister Tim Ayres said the federal government was working ""carefully"" with the state government and would not make announcements about future investments ""on the fly"". ""Of course, you would expect this is public money we're going through a proper due diligence process working carefully with our partners in the South Australian government,"" Mr Ayres said. ""I would be expecting to make announcements about that shortly."" Mr Malinauskas also attended a ribbon cutting ceremony on Tuesday to mark the completion of a $32.4 million upgrade of Whyalla Airport. The upgrade — funded with $16.2 million from the federal government, $13.8 million from the state and $2.4 million from the council — will allow QantasLink's 74-seat Q400 aircraft to service Whyalla. The council-owned airport was previously running on a deficit of $800,000 a year. It also suffered a drop in passenger numbers and the permanent departure of Rex Airlines due to a security screening charge."
"Man, 19, arrested over crash that killed woman and unborn child",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/man-19-arrested-over-crash-that-killed-woman-and-unborn-child-/105455770,2025-06-24,"Police have arrested a 19-year-old man in relation to a two-vehicle crash near Newcastle, where a woman and an unborn baby died. Police said that on Sunday about 2.40am a patrolling officer saw a sedan, allegedly bearing unauthorised number plates, driving on Newcastle Road in North Lambton. An attempt was made to stop the vehicle, but police allege it continued driving dangerously, and a decision was made not to engage in a pursuit due to safety concerns. A short time later, a second police car allegedly saw the sedan cross onto the wrong side of the road and then officers lost sight of the vehicle. Police continued to monitor the area before being called to reports of a head-on crash between the sedan and another vehicle. A passenger in the vehicle, a woman believed to be 55, died at the scene. The driver of the second vehicle, a 28-year-old woman, was taken to John Hunter Hospital, where she remains in a serious condition. Police said the woman was pregnant and had subsequently lost her unborn child. The driver of the sedan and the front passenger allegedly fled the scene before police arrived. Two rear seat passengers in the sedan, two girls aged 15 and 17, were taken to John Hunter Hospital where they both remain in serious condition. Just after 3pm today, a 19-year-old man was arrested at a home in Mayfield. He was taken to Waratah Police Station where he is assisting police. Police say officers have also spoken to a 17-year-old girl, who they believe was the front passenger in the vehicle. Inquiries into the crash continue under Strike Force Carrarang."
"Debt remains high, cost-of-living relief targeted at families in Qld budget",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/queensland-budget-cost-of-living-families-housing-debt/105453446,2025-06-24,"The Queensland government has announced new cost-of-living measures — headlined by a $100 voucher for families with school-aged children — replacing those introduced by its Labor predecessors last year. Treasurer David Janetzki handed down the LNP government's first budget today, projecting the state's debt to remain at record levels, likely eclipsing $205 billion by the 2028-29 financial year. That's down from the $218 billion forecast by the 2027-28 financial year in the mid-year budget update in January. The budget is expected to record an almost $9 billion deficit in the next financial year, reducing to $1.1 billion by 2028-29. Premier David Crisafulli promised debt would be lower under his government, and took a projected debt figure in their costings to the election of $171 billion by 2027-28. Mr Janetzki told parliament the deficit was driven by an ""unprecedented GST reduction"" of more than $2 billion, as well as declining coal royalties. ""The former government collected more in coal royalties in two years than what will be collected in the next four."" The government said the improved deficit position would be funded through capping annual expense growth, and curbing the number of non-frontline senior executives until 2028. Queensland families will receive a $100 voucher for each primary school student to help pay for uniforms, school books and excursions. The ""Back to School Boost"" will apply to the entire state, costing more than $180 million over the next four financial years. ""We're investing in this targeted program across the forwards to support Queensland families as part of a responsible and comprehensive cost of living package,"" Mr Janetzki said. Big ticket cost-of-living relief measures, $1,000 energy rebates, and discounted vehicle rego — introduced by the previous government last year — have ended. The electricity rebate scheme for vulnerable households, including seniors, pensioners and concession card holders, will increase by $14 to $386 after the government restored annual indexation. Prior to the budget, the government announced it would be continuing its Labor predecessors' $200 ""Play On"" vouchers to help with sports costs. From July 1, first home buyers can register for a new shared ownership scheme to reduce the deposit gap, known as ""Boost to Buy"". Available to 1,000 applicants over the next two years at a cost of $165 million, the government will support people to buy a home with as little as a 2 per cent deposit. A pre-election pledge, Mr Janetzki told parliament singles earning up to $150,000 and couples earning up to $225,000 will be eligible. ""This program has the highest income thresholds of any related scheme in the country, with the government investing up to 30 per cent equity for new builds and 25 per cent of existing homes, up to a home value of $1 million,"" he said. Other already announced housing measures include extending the $30,000 first home owner grant for 12 months, and almost $600 million in new funding for homelessness services. There is also a total $5.6 billion investment in social and community housing, with a record 52,000 people on the waitlist. The government plans to build 2,000 new social and community homes a year by 2028. Another part of the forecasted improved budget position will be a reduction in the money allocated for the Borumba Pumped Hydro Project, south of Gympie. Around $3 billion will go towards the renewable energy project over the next four financial years, with $355 million allocated to early works next year. The previous government had budgeted $8 billion in its last budget, with the total cost expected to exceed $18 billion. After axing the Pioneer-Burdekin Pumped Hydro Project, the largest facility of its kind in the world, the LNP has outlined details for its smaller projects. The government is investing $79 million for ongoing developments at Mt Rawdon and Stanwell, and will continue work on a Capricornia project, in partnership with the private sector. More than $33 billion will be invested in the public health system next financial year. The budget also allocated more than $18 billion in health infrastructure over the next five financial years. ""With new hospitals to be built at Toowoomba, Coomera and Bundaberg, and expansions for 10 existing hospitals, it will deliver more than 2,600 hospital beds across the state,"" Mr Janetzki said. ""We're boosting our frontline health workforce with more than 4,500 additional health workers in 2025/26, including doctors, nurses and paramedics."" The timeline for when the new hospitals and beds will be delivered remains unknown. In partnership with the federal government, $7.1 billion will be invested over seven years to deliver the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Nearly $1 billion of that has been budgeted for over the next four years to build athletes' villages. The state government is still working with the Commonwealth to upgrade agreements on how federal money will be spent for the venues program. Almost half a billion dollars has been dedicated to ""Destination 2045"",a tourism plan aimed at bringing more visitors to Queensland ahead of the Gamesand ensuring the sector is set up for the years beyond. The LNP rode to power on the back of their flagship ""adult crime, adult time"" policy. New facilities for additional prisoner capacity across Townsville and Brisbane will be funded with a $2.4 billion commitment. Almost $300 million will be dedicated to new and upgraded police stations and facilities across south-east Queensland, Cairns, and Palm Island. The government has promised to bolster the police force with 1,600 new recruits by the end of its first term, with a net 240 new officers delivered so far. Almost $150 million has been allocated for police equipment, including for tasers, vests, and body-worn cameras. More than $200 million will be invested into domestic and family violence protection, including for crisis accommodation, electronic monitoring of high-risk offenders, and funding for crisis response. A record $9 billion will be invested in restoring the Bruce Highway, in partnership with the Commonwealth. The infrastructure pipeline, worth almost $42 billion, includes funding for the Barron River Bridge, Logan and Gold Coast fast rail, and Mooloolah River interchange. The government will launch a new four year $20 million returning to work package to help transition women back into the workforce after having children, illness, or caring for family. Women who have taken time off work to raise a family will receive superannuation payments for the 52-week period of parent leave for Queensland public sector employees. ""By empowering women in the workplace, we're building a stronger, fairer and more prosperous Queensland,"" Mr Janetzki said. Shadow Treasurer Shannon Fentiman accused the government of painting a false narrative on Queensland's debt figures. ""Economists and rating agencies agreed with us, they juiced the books,"" she said. ""What is most disappointing is this playing politics with the budget has cost Queenslanders millions in interest repayments. ""Ratings agencies today have said that the risk to the credit rating remains elevated. This is a budget full of broken promises and bottlenecks and does not deliver the plans and future that Queenslanders want to see."""
"Australian music struggles on the charts, so ARIA is changing the rules",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/aria-charts-changing-singles-albums-top-50-australian-music/105455078,2025-06-24,"Zero Australian artists have made the top 50 singles chart this week, while just five locals feature in the equivalent albums chart. However, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) has announced sweeping changes to their charts in order to give Aussies a better chance at reaching the pointy end. From September, the ARIA Top 50 Singles and Albums charts, as well as the Top 20 Australian Artist Singles and Albums charts, will focus exclusively on music released within the past two years. Under the revisions, perennial hits such asThe Killers' unkillable Mr. Brightside, which has spent 157 weeks in the top 50, andVance Joy's Hottest 100-topping Riptide, a whopping 360 weeks in the Australian top 20, will make room for newer music and move to a new chart called ARIA On Replay. Formerly known as the Catalogue chart, On Replay will also showcase titles that have historically taken up near-permanent residence in the main charts. That includes multiple older Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran records, country stars Luke Combs and Zach Bryan, and classic Fleetwood Mac album Rumours, which has spent 403 weeks in the Top 50 Albums. Greatest hits compilations will also transition away from the main charts: everyone from Eminem (402 weeks) and Elton John (336 weeks) to Maroon 5 (321 weeks), Katy Perry (289 weeks) and The Weeknd (228 weeks). The two-year cut-off is being implemented to ""make the charts more dynamic"", ARIA chief executive Annabelle Herd told ABC Radio Melbourne. She says the current chart calculations ""[don't] really reflect what people are listening to in terms of new music… [these changes] will clear up a lot of space not just for new Australian music but new music generally"". The move comes after 12 months of ""modelling and consideration"" in consultation with the local industry in a bid to remove barriers for Australian music, which has struggled to compete against legacy releases and big-name overseas names popular on streaming platforms. It is the biggest change to the charts since ARIA began counting streaming figures towards singles (in 2014) and albums (in 2017), measuring them in combination with downloads and sales of physical formats including vinyl and CDs. The two-year cut-off rule, which is similar to those in place for France and New Zealand, hopes to renew interest in homegrown talent and address a plummeting local presence on the ARIA charts in recent years. The changes seek to improve ""discoverability"" of Australian music, which is being overshadowed in a crowded global marketplace. ""Our aim is to support the discovery and celebration of great Australian music at every stage of its life,"" Herd added in a statement. Only six Australians appeared across ARIA's 2024 end-of-year singles and album charts: Vance Joy, The Kid LAROI, DJ and producers Dom Dolla and Cyril, and compilations from Cold Chisel and INXS. So far this year, there has not been a single Australian to reach the number one spot on the singles chart, while homegrown acts topping the albums chart is a rarity. The debut solo album from Calum Hood of pop rockers 5 Seconds of Summer is currently at number one. The only other Australian albums to reach the top spot so far in 2025 are Jimmy Barnes's latest solo effort Defiant, Brisbane mainstaysBall Park Music's Like Love, and hip hop trioBliss N Eso's The Moon (The Light Side). Meanwhile, Western Sydney drill crew Onefour are sitting at number two with their debut album Look At Me Now. They follow Spacey Jane stalling at number two after their third album, If That Makes Sense, was kept from pole position by enigmatic UK metal act Sleep Token. The chart success of classics has often come at the expense of new music cutting through, but ARIA is introducing an exemption to recognise older songs that experience a Zeitgeist cultural moment. This week, Black Eyed Peas re-entered the Top 50 Singles chart with Rock That Body, 15 years after its initial release, thanks to the track going viral on TikTok. It follows in the footsteps of Kate Bush'sRunning Up That Hill getting a Stranger Things revivaland Fleetwood Mac's Dreams getting signal-boosted by askateboarding cranberry-juice-drinker. A special provision will allow other decades-old songs enjoying similar contemporary appeal to re-enter ARIA's Singles and Albums chart, as long as they meet a few criteria. Namely, titles can not have appeared in the top 100 for at least 10 years, and eligible music will only be considered upon request from record labels, demonstrating ""sufficient activity"" for placement in the top 30 or higher. Additionally, eligible titles will only remain in the Singles and Albums charts for up to 10 weeks. Lastly, the changes take effect after the 2025 ARIA Awards eligibility period, so this year's nominees will not be affected."
Bruce Lehrmann lodges court application to have rape charges halted,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/bruce-lehrmann-court-application-rape-charges-halted/105454924,2025-06-24,"Former Liberal Party staffer Bruce Lehrmann has filed a court application seeking that rape charges against him in Queensland be permanently halted. The application, filed this week in the Toowoomba District Court, seeks a declaration that intercepted phone calls between Mr Lehrmann's lawyers and Queensland police were ""illegally obtained"". The defence's application also requested that the defendant have a list of materials in the police investigation and a declaration that the Queensland Police Service ""do not have the power nor the discretion to determine what is relevant to a defence case and must disclose all materials in the course of the police investigation"". Mr Lehrmann's Sydney-based lawyer Zali Burrows filed the application for a permanent stay of the proceedings and for pre-trial directions and rulings under the Criminal Code. It follows weeks of legal wrangling between the Crown and Ms Burrows, who came on board as his legal representative after the case was committed for trial. Mr Lehrmann faces two counts of rape, alleged to have occurred in Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, in October 2021. Following a committal hearing in the Toowoomba Magistrates Court in July 2024, Mr Lehrmann was committed to stand trial in the Toowoomba District Court. In May this year, Ms Burrows told the District Court, during a mention of the case, that there was a ""shroud of secrecy"" over the police investigation into her client. On that occasion, Ms Burrows said the defence had only received about 200 pages of a 2,200-page download from the complainant's mobile phone records. The defence was also seeking access to all police notebooks, diary entries, emails and text messages related to the rape investigation. A hearing of the defence application for the police notebooks and other information has been set down for July 25 in the Toowoomba District Court. Mr Lehrmann's application for a permanent stay will be mentioned in the Ipswich District Court on Wednesday, as the Toowoomba District Court is not sitting this week. Court documents, filed in the Toowoomba District Court, also include an affidavit from the practice manager at the Toowoomba office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Peter Blake-Segovia. In that affidavit, Mr Blake-Segovia said that the arresting police officer, Detective Senior Constable Ashlee Ryder, had responded to him via email, setting out items in her possession that were not provided as part of the brief to the DPP, including: Mr Blake-Segovia said the police officer had also confirmed ""that there were two notebooks in her possession that were not part of the brief provided to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have sought these items be provided for disclosure."" The officer confirmed that all signed statements had been provided but that a further addendum, from the complainant, had been drafted but not yet signed. Once signed, it would be provided, the DPP officer said. The DPP said that once all items were received from the police officer, they would be reviewed ""to ascertain whether they ought to be disclosed"" prior to the hearing listed for July 25."
Another reshuffle looming for Australia in West Indies Tests,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/west-indies-australia-test-series-batting-line-up-josh-inglis/105454338,2025-06-24,"Josh Inglis is unsure where he will bat in the new-look Australian line-up as the vanquished Test champions prepare to play in the West Indies for the first time in a decade. Afterscoring a century on debut in Sri Lanka earlier this year, Inglis made way for the World Test Championship final at Lord's. But afterMarnus Labuschagne's long-term struggles continued and Steve Smith suffered a nasty dislocated fingerin the shock defeat to South Africa, Australia opted to bring Inglis and teenage tyro Sam Konstas in for the first Test in Barbados. In his two Tests in Galle, Inglis batted at number five asTravis Head pushed up to open, as he often has in Asia. But with Konstas almost certain to partner veteran opener Usman Khawaja in facing the new ball, Inglis could be asked to bat at number three. That would allow Cameron Green to shift to number four, now vacant due to Smith's injury. In his first Test for more than a year in the World Test Championship final, Green struggled at number three with scores of 4 and 0 in his return from back surgery. Inglis said he is unfazed where he bats, having constantly moved around in the first-class cricket for Western Australia and in international white-ball games. ABC Sportwill have live blog coverage of every day of all three West Indies-Australia Tests. ""I think it's just because I have done it, I feel comfortable going into different positions,"" Inglis told reporters at Bridgetown's Kensington Oval. ""I've batted at the top in white-ball cricket and in the middle, so I've become accustomed to moving around a fair bit, and [it's] something I pride myself on. ""With Smudge [Smith] getting injured, there was an opportunity for someone else to come in. ""I took a lot of confidence from [from Sri Lanka]; my debut Test match, it was nice to go out there and get a hundred."" Incumbent wicketkeeper Alex Carey will retain the gloves, meaning Inglis will likely be in the slip cordon between giants Green and Beau Webster. ""It's probably like a bail in between two stumps with me in between those two, so it should be good viewing on camera,"" he said. But the 30-year-old said he prided himself on fielding well, having only taken up wicketkeeping full-time when he was 14 years old. Coach Andrew McDonald and captain Pat Cummins have been open about this series being a ""reset"" for the group. They were unable to defend the Test title they won in 2023, but the first Test, starting Thursday midnight AEST, gets the new WTC cycle underway and presents the Test team's last hit-out before this summer's Ashes. Australia convincingly won both matches of the two-Test tour of the West Indies back in 2015. Star bowlers Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Nathan Lyon featured in the Caribbean a decade ago, but the other eight members of the XI have never played a Test in the region. Australia's batting order suddenly seems very inexperienced, with Konstas and Inglis having only played two Tests each, while all-rounder Beau Webster is preparing for his fifth. Windies pace sensationShamar Joseph will be hoping that coming up against Australia will again bring out his best. Joseph, in just his second Test, famously bowled the touring Windies to a famous and unlikely win over Australia at the Gabbathe last time the teams played a Test, in January 2024. AAP"
Five years ago it collapsed. Now Virgin Australia is back on the ASX,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/virgin-australia-returns-to-trade-on-the-asx-in-ipo/105451822,2025-06-24,"Virgin Australia shares have rallied as the airline has officially returned to the stock market, marking one of the most anticipated listings of the year and the latest chapter in its turbulent journey. Virgin's initial public offering (IPO) was priced at $2.90 per share, raising $685 million for the company. After the company resumed trade on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on Tuesday afternoon, Virgin shares ended 11.4 per cent higher, at $3.23. After collapsing into administration at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Virgin was rescued by US private equity giant Bain Capital and delisted from the stock exchange. Now the airline has taken off on the ASX once more, with a leaner business model, a new shareholder mix and the financial muscle of Qatar Airways behind it. At the completion of the IPO, Bain's stake in Virgin was reduced to about 40 per cent, while Qatar Airways retained about 23 per cent, according to the prospectus. At the bell-ringing ceremony at the ASX, Virgin chief executive Dave Emerson was loath to make any predictions around the share price on the first day of trade. ""We're focused on delivering long-term value for our shareholders, continuing to improve our performance, and so over time, I expect that to be reflected in stock price,"" he told reporters at Exchange Square in Sydney's CBD. The airline was not seeking to raise funds through the IPO, but rather to deliver a return to its existing owners, who would have their stake reduced. ""It's a great sign that we did not need to raise any money in this float, it means that we have a very strong balance sheet,"" Mr Emerson said. ""We didn't need any additional capital, in fact, we're generating strong returns and we're able to fund our fleet growth without needing new equity … so we feel very well set-up for the future."" Overnight, two Virgin services operated by Qatar Airways were diverted on their way to Doha due to the temporary closure of Qatar's airspace, as Iran launched missiles towards US air bases. One flight from Sydney and one from Brisbane were affected, with both landing safely. The Virgin CEO said he received a call at 3:30am from his operations team, informing him of the diversion: ""I thought, it was going to be a long day"". ""Things are trending in a very good direction much more quickly than I might have thought when I woke up this morning and so I'm optimistic about where we're headed. ""Our flights today are scheduled to operate, they'll probably be delayed but we're expecting to operate our regular schedule today and then hopefully it's business as usual from there."" Mr Emerson said the airline would continue operating flights as it was up to customers whether they wanted to travel in the current environment. ""We've got free change over the next week, if anybody doesn't want to travel, they're welcome to change their plans or they can cancel and get a complete refund,"" he said. ""We want to support our customers here and let people make their own decisions about what they're comfortable with."" More than five years ago now, Virgin's fall was swift and dramatic. However, it was also entirely predictable if one considered the fate of Ansett Australia. A fierce price war with Qantas had left Virgin financially vulnerable. Then came the global pandemic, grounding fleets and evaporating revenue almost overnight. ""Qantas was worried that Virgin Australia was going to attack its corporate travel market and go after the business market, so we had this brutal price war which left Virgin Australia a little bit weak,"" aviation analyst Peter Harbison told ABC News. ""And then when it was just starting to recover, COVID came along and it went into administration."" In April 2020, Virgin entered voluntary administration, with its boss blaming its failure to secure a federal government bailout. Within months,the airline was sold to Bain Capital for $3.5 billion. Bain Capital grounded budget offering Tiger Airways for good and set about repositioning Virgin as a mid-market offering. Virgin returned to profitability in 2023. Mr Harbison said Virgin Australia offered fewer inclusions than Qantas but broader appeal than budget airline Jetstar. ""The lounges are more limited. Its product is really very much tailored to the mid-market, which does suggest quite a lot."" Mr Emerson described the airline as ""different in almost every way as far as the business model goes"" to the Virgin that collapsed during the pandemic. ""We're serving the small business, serving the value corporate, serving the premium leisure segment, those people who really value the product that we put out there … we've changed the whole business model, but what hasn't changed is our focus on delivering great service."" As of February this year, Virgin has an additional backer in government-owned Qatar Airways, which bought a 25 per cent stake in the airline and delivers more access to international routes. ""Now with Qatar, they have a very tidy deal which will very much help them in the future,"" Mr Harbison said. Despite that, he did not line up to buy shares in the relisted Virgin. ""It is a highly risky business. The profitability margin over the last 70-odd years since the Second World War is pitiful."" The answer, according to analyst Mr Harbison, could be no. He argued meaningful airfare reductions are unlikely without government intervention to free up airport slots and increase competition. That is despite regional carrier Rex set to become government-owned if alternative buyers can't be found. Mr Harbison said, with Rex firmly positioned as a regional airline, the Qantas–Virgin duopoly will remain. ""The only thing that is going to produce lower airfares is if demand slackens,"" Mr Harbison said. ""And it's not really showing a lot of signs of that at the moment — consumer confidence is reasonably high."" Mr Harbison said while Virgin IPO may result in some money spent on fleet renewal and other improvements, another price war with Qantas was unlikely. ""Qantas doesn't really want to rock the boat, it likes having Virgin there with a third of the market as long as it doesn't get too aggressive. However, in recent weeks, Qantas has shown signs of ramping up competition in the trans-Tasman market, adding around 60,000 additional seats for December and January, taking on Air New Zealand. Aviation expertNeil Hansford told ABC News the additional capacity could keep a lid on prices, in good news for travellers. ""You're not going to see anything like the price increases that could possibly have existed had Qantas not put all this extra capacity into the market,"" he said."
We waited two decades for a 28 Days Later sequel. It doesn't disappoint,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/28-years-later-review-danny-boyle-ralph-fiennes-jody-comer/105449988,2025-06-24,"It hasn't quite been 28 years since a bleary-eyed Cillian Murphy drifted onto the streets of a deserted London, in 2002's 28 Days Later, which redefined the zombie film for a new millennium. What:A 12-year-old member of a secluded island community ventures into zombie-infected Britain. Starring:Alfie Williams, Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson Directed by:Danny Boyle Likely to make you feel:Like the wait was worth it Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland flooded Britain with a 'rage virus' that evolved the undead from a shuffling, slow-burn threat into a frenzied foe. Its frenetic editing and MiniDV cinematography established the visual hallmarks for a paranoid era of post-9/11 horror. The timing of the film's sequel, 28 Years Later, now in Australian cinemas, feels apt. Zombie films have found major commercial success in recent decades but, creatively, they've stalled. The fast zombies and gritty survivalist narrative of Boyle's original film have been endlessly recycled. It's telling that the most popular example of the genre, HBO's The Last of Us, is an adaptation of a 2013 video game. If the apocalypse was a fun hypothetical to consider in the early 2010s — the peak of zombie saturation — the pandemic has made societal collapse a more immediate reality. Boyle, now 68 years old, has lost little of the apoplectic fury that charged his pioneering classic. 28 Years Later begins on a secluded island whose inhabitants have successfully weathered the few decades since the rage virus broke containment. The fortified community is connected to mainland Britain via a low-lying coastal path, where villagers go to gather resources — and, in the case of 12-year-old Spike (Alfie Williams), score a first infected kill. As part of his coming-of-age rite, Spike's father, Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Nosferatu), accompanies him for his first encounter with the undead. Their mission quickly goes sideways when they encounter an Alpha, a mutated variant with colossal strength and a pack of underlings under command. The mainland is also revealed to be home to Ian Kelson (Ralph Fiennes, Conclave), a doctor branded as a madman by the villagers for his unconventional handling of the undead but, potentially, the only hope for Spike's mother, Isla (Jodie Comer, Killing Eve), whose mind and body have been wracked by a mysterious disease. The first stretch of the film is an effectively nervy exercise in folk horror but it's not immediately clear why, after so many years, Boyle and Garland decided to revisit this world. Save for some flashes of clever world-building (the village being comprised of die-hard Queen Liz royalists is a bleakly hilarious touch), the expanded scope of 28 Years Later initially stays confined to well-trodden genre territory. Cultish enclaves are a persistent rash in the post-apocalypse, while the virus's Alpha mutation is a cliché better suited to video games. One of the early surprises is that, with the scarcity of human flesh, some of the sprinting zombies of yore have now been reduced to a crawl. The transition from MiniDV's hypnotically hazy textures to iPhone cinematography makes for an intriguing stylistic refresh, if not a revolutionary one. In the hands of returning DP Anthony Dod Mantle (who steered the early digital innovations of theDogme 95 movement), the iPhone 15 Max footage lends an eerie unreality to the film, visible in its deep focus, wide angles and sharp edges, the horizon hanging oppressively across the overgrown landscape. Unlike a typical phone recording, the image is stretched into a panoramic aspect ratio (usually reserved for Hollywood epics), while colours are intensified into irradiated hues. It's an astonishing advertisement for what consumer electronics are capable of nowadays, though the film resists some of the more idiosyncratic limitations of pocket cameras. There's a noticeable shift away from its scrappy, low-budget origins, with the occasional use of drones and expensive cinema cameras adding an additional sheen to its exterior. The particulars of Spike's narrative are better left to be discovered, especially as the film saves its most tantalising ideas for its final stretch; an imminent follow-up, directed by Candyman's Nia Da Costa, is set for release in just seven months, leaving this legacy sequel feeling a little incomplete. The human story of 28 Years Later is surprisingly compelling in its own right and, unlike the broader expansion of this world, is kept satisfyingly contained. Fiennes utterly commands the third act of the film with a unique take on Dr Kelson's enigmatic, Kurtz-like figure, whose towering monuments to death comprise the film's most striking imagery. If rage fuelled the early days of the virus outbreak, grief is now the guiding light through its long-term ravages. Amid the exorbitant displays of brutality, death is treated with an unexpected tenderness that raises 28 Years Later to new emotional heights within the genre. After a character has their spinal cord ripped from their body, we observe in great detail as their head is thrust into a kiln, scrubbed free of its charred scalp, and washed. You'll have to trust me when I say it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. 28 Years Later is in cinemas now."
Manslaughter trial delayed after key witnesses escape fire,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/torney-alleged-manslaughter-emma-bates-cobram-fire-witnesses/105454016,2025-06-24,"A man charged with manslaughter will have his trial delayed after two key witnesses escaped a fire days before they were due to appear in court. John Torney, 40, is facing charges of negligent manslaughter over the death of 49-year-old Emma Bates last year. Ms Bates was found dead by emergency services who were called to her home in the northern Victorian town of Cobram in April 2024. Members of Ms Bates's family were present in the courtroom on Tuesday. Mr Torney, who also faces several assault-related charges, was due to appear during the four-day court hearing. Prosecutor Matthew Cookson told the court that police conducted a welfare check at the weekend on Mr Torney's brother who was a key witness in the matter along with Mr Torney's mother. Mr Cookson said Mr Torney's brother lit a fire when police arrived which resulted in the house being destroyed. Mr Cookson told the court that Mr Torney's mother who was hospitalised, was ""physically OK"" but had lost all possessions and was effectively homeless. Mr Torney's lawyer Hayden Rattray told the court that his client had been in custody for more than a year. Magistrate Stephen Ballek said the fire was an ""extreme development"" and that it was in ""the interests of justice"" to allow the prosecutor's application to adjourn the matter to October this year."
Medical centre trespasser caused 'over $7 million in damages',https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/court-told-of-damage-bill-to-bragg-centre-trespass-and-flooding/105454560,2025-06-24,"A man who manually set off fire hydrants, sending 63,800 litres of water gushing into the Australian Bragg Centre over half an hour, caused losses of almost $7.9 million, a court has heard. Daniel Michael Loeser, 31, of Ingle Farm, entered through a fire door and set off fire hydrants on six levels at the clinical and medical research facility on January 5 this year, causing ""substantial damage"" to multiple levels of the building on Adelaide's North Terrace. The District Court heard Loeser was amid a drug-induced psychosis, had recently been released from the City Watch House and was intending to seek medical help from the neighbouring Royal Adelaide Hospital at the time. Prosecutor Lauren Docking told the court the $7,896,462 damage bill included about $6 million for the loss of rent, because tenants had been unable to use the building due to the flooding. ""Although the financial loss is to be predominantly covered by insurance, there was also a disruption to the extremely important work and service provided by the tenants of the Bragg Centre."" Ms Docking told the court the centre ""includes a research and therapy centre specialising in proton radiation treatment to paediatric, adolescent and adult patients who are battling rare forms of cancer"". She said Loeser, who ""unlawfully"" entered the building via a fire door, ""manually opened the fire hydrant valves on levels eight, nine, 10, 12, 13 and 14, causing severe flooding"". The court heard a firefighter found Loeser in a kitchen area holding ""large kitchen knives"". He was ""not threatening anyone with them, but he wasn't initially letting go of them"", Ms Docking said. Loeser was arrested and later pleaded guilty to a basic count of serious criminal trespass and a charge of damaging a building, on the basis that he was reckless. Ms Docking said the only appropriate penalty was a prison term, to which Loeser's defence lawyer, Andrew Ey, agreed. Mr Ey said his client was ""suffering some sort of drug-induced psychosis"" at the time, and had been intending to seek help from the Royal Adelaide Hospital. ""His instructions are that he was wishing to attend and obtain medical treatment of some sort. ""In his confused and dysregulated state, he was unable to make the connection that he was in the wrong place. He said his client had been arrested the day before, on January 4, for being unlawfully on premises after refusing to leave an acquaintance's home. Mr Ey said Loeser was arrested, taken to the City Watch House and ""somewhat surprisingly given his state"", released on bail. ""He wanders through the city and then finds himself at the Bragg Centre shortly thereafter,"" he said. He said his client had been ""up for a number of days"" after consuming GHB and methamphetamine and was coming off the drugs when he entered the building. He asked Judge Geraldine Davison to be as lenient as possible when sentencing Loeser, and asked her to impose a longer-than-usual non-parole period to allow Loeser to be supervised and drug tested when released from custody. Judge Davison said Loeser, who will be sentenced next month, was ""quite literally caught in the act""."
"Cairns hospital patient dies from rare, soil-borne disease",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/melioidosis-cases-and-deaths-in-queensland/105454874,2025-06-24,"A hospital patient in Far North Queensland has died from the rare soil-borne disease, melioidosis. The fatality reported by the Cairns Hospital and Health Service, is the 32nd fatal case of melioidosis recorded in Queensland this year. The patient was diagnosed with the tropical disease at the start of June. Melioidosis is caused by a bacterium found in soil and water in northern Australia. Most cases occur during the wet season or after heavy rain or flooding. Queensland experienced a significantly above-average wet season from October to April. Townsville in particular recorded its highest wet-season rainfall on record. The record-breaking rain has prompted a surge in melioidosis cases with 235 patients diagnosed with the disease in Queensland this year. It's almost four times the number of cases recorded this time last year. In 2024 Queensland Health recorded a total of 81 melioidosis cases. Queensland Health stated that the outbreak of melioidosis peaked in April and, over the past seven days, the state had not recorded any new cases. There is no vaccine to prevent melioidosis, but Queensland Health said people in North Queensland should take care around soil and muddy water. Anyone gardening is urged to wear gloves and footwear, and those using pressure hoses should wear a face mask. Queensland Health data shows 74 per cent of the 235 melioidosis cases detected this year were in people aged 50 or older. Ninety-four per cent of cases were people who were particularly vulnerable to the disease, with underlying health conditions like diabetes and cancer. Symptoms of melioidosis include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, and sepsis can occur in rare cases."
Driver to face trial over intersection crash that killed 16-year-old,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/shiva-kumar-jandhyala-trial-over-crash-hat-killed-ruby-crowley/105452986,2025-06-24,"A Shepparton man has been committed to stand trial in the County Court after pleading not guilty to killing a teenage passenger in a road collision in northern Victoria. Shiva Kumar Jandhyala, 31, from Kialla, is alleged to have driven through a stop sign and collided with two other vehicles in Pine Lodge on April 19, last year. The collision occurred at the Boundary Road-New Dookie Road intersection about 6:30pm. One of Mr Jandhyala's passengers, 16-year-old Ruby Crowley from Lemnos, a farming hamlet on the outskirts of Shepparton, was seriously injured and died in hospital. Another passenger, a 32-year-old man, also from Lemnos, was also seriously hurt. The drivers and passengers in the other vehicles were treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Mr Jandhyala appeared at Shepparton Magistrates Court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to dangerous driving causing death and dangerous driving causing serious injury. He is also facing three other charges, including failing to stop. The court heard from three police witnesses, including Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Jenelle Hardiman, of Victoria Police's collision reconstruction unit. Mr Jandhyala's defence barrister Kyle McDonald asked her about the safety of the intersection, including visibility at the time of the crash. The court heard drivers travelling south along Boundary Road — as Mr Jandhyala was — had an obstructed view of drivers travelling west on New Dookie Road due to vegetation at the intersection. Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Hardiman agreed but told the court that if Mr Jandhyala had obeyed the stop sign, it would not have been an issue. ""We know that from [the] airbag control module and from the momentum of that collision."" Asked if she considered the intersection to be dangerous due to its layout and the approaches, as well as a lack of safety features like flashing signs, Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Hardiman said she did. Asked if an appropriate safety ""treatment"" for the intersection would include regularly trimmed vegetation, she said: The court heard Mr Jandhyala's car was travelling at 55kph at the time of the collision. The court was also told Ms Crowley was not wearing a seatbelt and it was not clear if the 32-year-old man was.Magistrate Simon Zebrowski said he was satisfied there was enough evidence to commit Mr Jandhyala to stand trial. The matter will return to the County Court in Melbourne on July 22."
Child prodigies speak about the importance of just being kids,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/what-its-like-to-be-a-child-prodigy/105437564,2025-06-24,"The story of Australian pianist Geoffrey Tozer, as narrated in Janine Hosking's documentary The Eulogy, follows a familiar, tragic arc. In the 60s and 70s, Tozer seemed set to be one of Australia's biggest international success stories. By age 16, Tozer had performed on some of the world's most famous stages and met the who's who of classical music. But away from the piano, Tozer seemed to lack any other skills. In later life, he dealt with alcohol addiction, dying in penury in 2009. Classical music's history is peppered with stories of exceptionally talented child musicians including household names like Mozart and Mendelssohn. Even today, young performers like violinists Christian Li and Chloe Chua have attracted enormous attention for their early success. Tozer described his experience of being a child prodigy like ""an old man with no future. I wouldn't wish it on anybody."" But unlike Tozer, many prodigies have gone on to have happier lives and successful music careers as they've grown up. Australian pianists Andrea Lam and Grace Kim were both labelled as prodigies when they were younger. Lam made her debut with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra aged 13. Kim was winning international music competitions before she finished high school. They speak about their experiences navigating the label of ""child prodigy"" and how to support the next generation in their musical journeys. Lam remembers how surreal her orchestral debut felt, describing it as ""an incredible sensory experience"". ""[I was] on stage making music with professional musicians who were treating me with respect and being on the same playing field as them."" Lam remembers her teenage years as ""the good days"". She had opportunities to hone her craft, but along with her recognition as a young musician, ""I had enough time to be a kid,"" Lam reflects. In her youth, Kim preferred watching TV and reading books over spending time practising. She loves playing the piano, learning new music and performing, but ""the practice part was the most boring thing in the whole world,"" Kim admits. Despite this tendency, Kim did well in elite competitions thanks to her ability to ""wing it."" ""Gifted kids [like myself] tend to find ways to do what they like doing and try to avoid what they don't like doing,"" Kim says. But as an adult, Kim doesn't see ""giftedness"" as a celebration of exceptionalism. She says it should be regarded as part of our neurodiversity. ""As someone with children now, I realise the importance of structure,"" she says. ""As a grown adult, I started practising more regularly."" As a piano teacher and researcher, Kim also supports the next generation of talented pianists, some of whom have gone on to win international music competitions. She says maintaining boundaries between parents, teachers and students is important in supporting young musicians in their journeys. ""The parent's job is to offer love and support,"" she says. ""My role as a teacher is to give the students challenges that are proportional to their ability."" It's up to the students to develop their skills as musicians. Audiences are always fascinated by displays of young musical talents, and we have an abundance of them. Violinist Christian Li was just 10 years old when he won the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition in 2018. Taking joint first prize with Li was 11-year-old Singapore-based violinist Chloe Chua. Now in their teens, both violinists regularly perform with major symphony orchestras, a feat which takes most musicians years to achieve. Chua, 18, recently made her Australian debut alongside the Singapore Symphony Orchestra in a performance at the Sydney Opera House in February. ""I find the process of learning music of different genres and by different composers very fun,"" Chua says. ""And I feel very emotionally satisfied after I have mastered a violin piece."" Chua, who is still finishing high school, is famed for her sensitive musical interpretations. ""I love to captivate and move my audiences with expressive performances and bring joy to them,"" Chua says. Lam and Kim highlight that we should move away from the idea that young performers should wholly focus on only developing their musical talents. ""You have all of your life to be an adult, but you have a very specific window of time to enjoy being a kid,"" Lam says. Some of the harmful ideas around prodigies concern how much they should practise and external pressure for excellence. The expectation for constant excellence can be hard for young musicians, Lam says. While Lam stresses playing an instrument at an elite level does take dedication and hours of practice, Kim says the myth that musicians should practise between eight to 10 hours a day is not healthy. ""Parents do need to create opportunities for these kids to de-stress, be healthy, exercise and focus on other things in life."" The opportunity to be just kids is one of the secrets to the longevity of their success, Lam and Kim say. Chua's family and friends ensure she has time to just be a teenager. ""I normally take breaks between classes or my practice sessions to go out for meals with friends,"" Chua says. ""Sometimes, I also attend parties organised by the school or concerts to socialise with friends."" Lam recalls how much she liked reading and going out with her friends, some of whom are still close to her. Chua also shares similar hobbies during her free time. Kim points out that for young musicians and their parents, ""music is a long game"". ""We can't stop people from labelling, but we can help ground the child by not buying into the wave,"" Kim says. ""Children need to develop the skills to be able to achieve goals in their own way,"" Kim says. ""They also need time to figure that out.""

Native forests in firing line ahead of likely shot-hole borer spread,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/shot-hole-borer-native-forest-concerns-western-australia/105445194,2025-06-24,"Biosecurity experts say it is only a matter of time until the invasive polyphagous shot-hole borer breaks quarantine lines in metropolitan Perth and spreads throughout the state. The invasive beetle has already had a devastating impact on Perth's urban tree canopy, felling thousands of trees. It is feared the effects could be replicated in the native forests of Western Australia's South West. The WA government last week announced it efforts to eradicate the polyphagous shot-hole borer had failed. It haschanged its strategyfrom eradication, to management. It has since poured an additional $26.5 million into its shot-hole borer response, which includes the continuation of two quarantine zones in Perth for at least 18 months. The shot-hole borer is less than two millimetres long and spreads a fungus that can starve trees of nutrients, killing them in the process. Experts are unsure how the pest arrived in the country. Jacquie Rusha, who manages a native plant nursery in Bunbury, said biosecurity would become increasingly important as the beetle spread. ""It was inevitable that they were going to have to accept that it wasn't going to be contained,"" Ms Rusha said. The nursery specialises in propagating and growing local native species for retail and landscaping projects. Plants are grown onsite and are only shipped to the site under strict quarantine protocols. However, Ms Rusha said she was concerned about the unknown impacts on the native environment as a whole. ""If we were to come across an infestation here, we would be able to quarantine immediately and find it a lot sooner than we would in the wild,"" she said. ""We don't know how this will all end up looking in the end, but we might lose some of those really key species of plants, particularly marri. ""This change in management certainly doesn't mean that we give up and go, 'oh well, it's just here now'. ""It means that if anything, we become more vigilant."" Introduced species of trees, including the box elder maple and coral tree, are extremely susceptible to the shot-hole borer. But many Australian natives are also at high risk, including the Moreton bay fig, marri and red flowering gum. Invasive Species Council policy director Carol Booth said 15 native tree species in WA had already been identified as highly or very highly susceptible to the pest. ""Now that eradication is off the table, the priority must be stopping the borer from spreading beyond the Perth region,"" Dr Booth said. Ecologist Bruce Webber said the breach of containment lines in Perth was ""inevitable"" due to the eventual shift from cost-sharing between state and federal governments to just state funding. The WA government said the quarantine zones would be maintained for the next 18 months as authorities transitioned to management of the pest. ""After that period, the federal and state cost-sharing model disappears, and this simply then becomes yet another invasive species added to the very long list that are being managed and funded at the state level,"" Dr Webber said. What was less certain was the impact the beetle would have on the environment once it arrived. ""It's simply going to be a matter of suck it and see, and that's a pretty scary outcome given we know there are already impacts identified to our native species,"" Dr Webber. ""We don't know the full extent of the species that will be impacted as the borer inevitably spreads out to these native landscapes,"" Dr Webber said. ""But if it's anything to go by from what we've seen in Perth, there's serious concerns for how our native landscapes will be impacted in the long term. ""We're essentially flying blind as this beetle moves into our native landscapes."" Federal Agriculture Minister Julie Collins has been contacted for comment."
'Lab-grown meat' approved for sale in Australia. Will people eat it?,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/lab-grown-meat-approved-for-sale-australia/105448604,2025-06-24,"In a kitchen in inner Sydney, chef Kevin Condon is listing the ingredients that go into his signature foie gras dish. Most aren't too striking: garlic, brandy, butter. But one is so rare that it's only just been approved for consumption in Australia. This foie gras, a specialty dish made from liver, is derived from Japanese quail — which is an uncommon sighting on any menu. But the meat itself didn't come from any slaughtered animal. It was ""grown"" from real meat cells in a factory. It's conventionally known as ""lab-grown"" or cell-cultured meat and has just been deemed safe to eat by Australia's food regulator. The novel food product is made by multiplying individual cells (taken from an animal, dead or alive) in a large tank of liquid, much like at a brewery, and then turning that paste into a food product, such as foie gras or mince. ""We put the cells in a nutrient broth that is essentially recreating a lot of the conditions in which cells grow in our body. ""There's amino acids, sugars … and that is what is actually allowing the cells to grow in a way that's very similar to what you'd see in a brewery,"" Ellen Dinsmoor explains on a recent tour of a lab-grown meat factory in Sydney. Ms Dinsmoor is the chief operating officer of Vow, one of two lab-grown meat startups in Australia. The other is Melbourne-based Magic Valley, whose business strategy is different, targeting the mass-market consumer with its mince products. After a two-year-long process, Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) has given the green light for Vow's product to be sold for consumption. The cultured Japanese quail foie gras is expected to be landing on the plates of diners in a few high-end restaurants in Sydney and Melbourne within months, if all goes to plan for the company. In their decision, FSANZ said: ""Our assessment concluded that the product is safe for human consumption and presents no toxicological, nutritional or allergenic concerns. ""The quail cell line was found to be genetically stable, and microbiological risks associated with its production can be effectively managed through established food safety controls."" Despite this decision by the regulator, and the fact that cultivated meat has been made for well over a decade, only a handful of countries around the world have approved it as safe for sale, and Italy as well as several US states have banned it. Curtain University sustainability expert Dora Marinova says the industry has a way to go to convince consumers it's safe and nutritious to eat. ""There isn't that much enthusiasm, mainly because people are not familiar with the product and also particularly young people are very sceptical,"" Professor Marinova tells ABC News, while tucking into a salad wrap at a Perth cafe. Because lab-grown meat companies are starting from scratch — literally, with an animal's microscopic individual cells — the world is their oyster in terms of what creatures they can make into meat. ""We can grow meat from any animal,"" Ms Dinsmoor explains, standing in the company's headquarters in front of a brainstorming whiteboard that includes ideas such as crocodile medallions and shark fin soup. ""We look at all of the animals out there and we say, what would taste the most delicious? What would be the most nutritious for people? ""Our cell library has over 50 different types of cells in it!"" Vow even made a ""woolly mammoth meatball"" (made from cultured cells from the DNA of woolly mammoths and African elephants) two years ago in a publicity stunt to showcase the potential of its technology — though no one was able to try it. The creators of Vow say they first designed the product to address global food shortages, where current systems don't produce enough food to feed a growing global population. However, Ms Dinsmoor admits cell-cultured meat is not currently a viable alternative to conventional farmed meat, as it could not yet be produced at a large enough scale. ""I'd love to say it is, but this facility you see behind me is actually the largest operational cultured meat facility in the world. ""And right now what you see here, while impressive, can't feed all of Australia, let alone many other countries,"" she tells The Business, from Vow's factory in inner Sydney, where a giant bioreactor is currently ""growing"" meat cells for their product. Other key industry claims include that lab-made meat is more environmentally friendly as it does not require large farmland for animals to be grown, and that it is more ethical as the animal does not have to be slaughtered to produce meat. Monash University biotechnology research scientist Paul Wood says, at present, the process of making lab-grown meat is quite energy intensive. ""So unless you're using totally renewable energy, then you're not going to be more sustainable on an energy basis."" Aside from considerations such as the safety of the product and ethical claims, the other key question is commercial: will people buy it? Curtin University's Professor Marinova has been studying cell-cultured meat and the views of consumers. ""People are curious … but whether they will stick to this choice when there are other alternatives is something that the industry will need to be prepared to respond to in a way that they can attract, sustain and maintain interest in the consumers."" She says a degree of hesitancy or uncertainty still exists about the product, even now it has been approved for sale by the food regulator. Professor Marinova has been speaking to gen Z consumers in particular, who she says are ""not confident at all"" about the product, yet. ""They're quite innovative as [a] generation … they're actually quite curious, they are quite inquisitive, and they are open to new dietary choices. ""As long as we have the right messages and the right information, they can probably be convinced. But at the moment they're not."" She says for younger consumers in particular, the perception of the product being more environmentally friendly was a key selling point. ""Most of these businesses are building on the environmental concerns that people have because there is more awareness of the high environmental footprint of the food choices that we have, and particularly meat and red meat has a very, very high associated greenhouse gas emissions, land use."" Vow's Ellen Dinsmoor says the carbon footprint of cell-based meat had the potential to be lower, given it could be produced in an inner-city lab like theirs. The high costs and energy use associated with making lab-grown meat at this stage have meant it is largely a niche product, according to Professor Wood. ""I've always said it'll remain a niche product — a niche product in high-value markets."" He says the industry has recently faced challenges from cost pressures and a drop in investor interest in the alternative meat sector. ""I think the biggest issue is cost and scale. This is an expensive product to make. You need special equipment, you need expensive media [the liquid chemicals in which the cells grow]."" Some startups will find scaling up a challenge because of the high production cost and lack of funding interest for the sector currently, Professor Wood notes. Vow's Ms Dinsmoor confirms the drop-off in investment interest. ""Food tech is not the space to be right now — artificial intelligence is, and especially because the plant-based sector, which we're often lumped in with, has not done well over the last few years,"" she says. Based on the current trajectory, Professor Wood said the global market could shrink further as companies consolidated. ""I think we're up to about 170 companies around the world. We are already seeing some of those companies either going out of business or being purchased,"" he observed. Professor Dora Marinova believes lab-grown meat would likely remain as a complementary food product, rather than replace conventionally farmed meat altogether. While Sydney-based Vow had plans to grow off the back of approvals from Food Standards Australia, earlier this year they were forced to lay off 25 per cent of their staff. ""Right now, we don't have the time or budget to double down on research and development,"" Ms Dinsmoor explained. ""Most of the folks affected by those lay-offs in January were scientists, engineers, many of whom had been with the company since its earliest days. She says the company hopes to be selling at a profitable margin within the first few months of launching their quail product in Australia this year."
The maternity care that took Tara's BMI out of the equation,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/dealing-with-weight-stigma-while-pregnant/105291530,2025-06-24,"Early in her pregnancy, Tara Sawyer was told the local hospital would not be able to accommodate her. ""Because of my higher BMI, you automatically have to go to Box Hill rather than Angliss Hospital,"" says the 29-year-old from Emerald/land of the Bunurong and Wurundjeri peoples in Victoria. ""Initially I was quite upset about that because I'm a teacher, I work full-time, and it meant all my appointments had to be an hour away, so I had to take a whole day off work to have an appointment. ""It led to stress in my job, which was not ideal."" Tara says she also felt ashamed to tell people why she had to travel to a different hospital. ""My husband and I talk about weight all the time, but even just to tell him I can't go to this hospital because I'm overweight, was quite embarrassing."" Recent research from Monash University has found reducing women's experiences of weight stigmashould lead to better careand better pregnancy outcomes for larger-bodied women. It shows larger-bodied women are sometimes automatically treated as high-risk, whichthe authors writeis ""problematic because it focuses on body size rather than health"". BMI is a method usedto sort patients by weight into four categories from underweight to obese. Its appropriateness as a measure of healthy weight for individualshas long been contested. For Tara, the redirection to a hospital further away ended up being a ""blessing in disguise"", thanks to a program dedicated to maternity care for women with a high BMI. ""It meant that I could opt to not be weighed at each appointment, not be told about my weight, or be told only if I wanted,"" Tara says. We spoke to Tara about her pregnancy journey, and how, for the first time, her weight meant she received more care, rather than less. These are her words. I had been on a health journey for about 10 years prior to being pregnant, with what I assumed was an autoimmune disease. I really struggled to get care early on. The default response from most doctors about my symptoms was to exercise more and lose weight. I was aware of my weight, but struggled to lose any, and suspected whatever else condition I had was contributing to that. I also have anxiety, and at one point I was having some internal bleeding investigated. When they didn't find a cause, I had a specialist gastroenterologist tell me what it was probably just anxiety causing those symptoms. After about three years of fighting to have my voice heard, I was finally referred to a rheumatologist who has taken my condition seriously. I also found a fantastic GP who has listened to my fear of being dismissed because of my weight, and made sure unless my bloods indicated it was a problem, or I came in concerned about my weight, it would not be factored into my care and treatment. I actually fall into the catchment of Angliss Hospital, but due to having a suspected autoimmune condition, borderline high hypertension, and a high BMI, I was told I had to present to Box Hill and receive care there. I was quite frustrated and embarrassed I had to do that. But it did work out for the best. I was told about thePEARL (Pregnancy Elevated BMI Antenatal Risk reduction and Lifestyle) program. It's run by this beautiful midwife Maddy (Madeline Hawke). She was concerned about weight stigma with pregnancy and how many women deal with a lot of weight conversations in pregnancy that are not necessarily important to that pregnancy. I saw Maddy and the same obstetrician throughout my pregnancy. We didn't really discuss weight. At one point I raised concerns about how much I was putting on, but I was assured it was in the normal range for women with my BMI. There was also an honest conversation about why it's sometimes recommended women with high BMI be induced, but it was presented to me as research and fact, rather than pressure or opinion to sway me one way or the other. I kind of got the ""royal treatment"". I met another woman in the program and she said to me, ""It's like the first time that being overweight has been a positive in my life"". I felt the same way. Despite the great care, I had such an awful pregnancy with pain and pre-natal depression. It was a really hard time. But I would give birth every day of the week. I loved it. It was such a positive experience. The midwives and team were amazing. I put that down to all the research I did. Familiarising myself with hospital policies on what I could and couldn't push back on. Having a thorough birth plan. I learnt that I was always entitled to ask for a second opinion, and ask for a second doctor if I wasn't happy with my care. It's your right to ask for that. And I know it's really hard; as women we are seen as being rude and up-front when advocating for ourselves. But pregnancy is one of the most vulnerable times in your life, you want to make sure the people in the room have your best interests at heart, and don't look down on you because of your weight."
Albury doctor charged after child abuse images allegedly found on phone,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/albury-doctor-charged-with-child-abuse-material-offence/105455602,2025-06-24,"Detectives have charged an Albury doctor after an investigation found alleged child abuse material on his phone. In May, Australian Border Force officers seized a phone from a 37-year-old man at Melbourne Airport. The phone was then referred to the NSW State Crime Command's Sex Crimes Squad, where detectives allegedly found more than 5,000 video and photo files of child abuse material. Detectives working under the Strike Force Trawler operation, which undertakes ongoing investigations into the online exploitation of children, arrested Gregory John Couch in Albury on Tuesday morning. He wascharged with several offences, including possessing child abuse material and using a carriage to access child abuse material. After his arrest, the doctor was taken to Albury police station before appearing at Albury Local Court. He was refused bail and will face Albury Local Court again on August 19.

Police deny patient reached for officer's gun at SA hospital,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/patient-allegedly-reached-for-police-gun-at-fmc-emergency/105450260,2025-06-24,"Doctors have alleged a patient attempted to grab a police officer's firearm at one of Adelaide's biggest public hospitals — a claim SA Police has denied. The allegation is outlined in a report sent by the SA Salaried Medical Officers Association (SASMOA) to the state's work safety authority, following doctor concerns of a recent ""escalation of violence"" at the Flinders Medical Centre (FMC) emergency department in Adelaide's south. ""One doctor stated: 'This was a near miss, critical incident, (potential) mass shooting',"" SASMOA chief industrial officer, Bernadette Mulholland, wrote in the report. ""The medical officer was clearly shaken."" But SA Police rejected that claim, saying it had investigated to ""substantiate the accuracy of the allegation"". A spokesperson said police determined that a patient ""approached"" a police security officer (PSO) inside the hospital, but ""at no time did this patient grab at the PSO's firearm"". According to Ms Mulholland, the alleged incident occurred last Friday. ""The violent patient had been restrained in one cubicle and had been sleeping,"" she wrote in the report to SafeWork SA. ""The patient woke up. ""Across from this patient's cubicle another patient had police security. ""The police officer who was looking after their patient was unaware that the patient in the other cubicle had awoken. Ms Mulholland wrote that after the incident, ""fear ran right through the medical staff"". ""I attended (Flinders Medical Centre) at approx. 5.00 PM and spoke to doctors who were clearly shaken and worried and wanted a response,"" she wrote. In a statement to ABC News, SA Police said police security officers were at the Flinders Medical Centre on Friday undertaking guard duties for a person in police custody. “One of the PSOs was approached by a patient from an adjacent cubicle, however, at no time did this patient grab at the PSO’s firearm, nor did the PSO perceive that this patient presented a risk to the member’s safety,” a spokesperson said. “The PSO did direct the patient to move away, and they were escorted back to their bed.” SA Health confirmed a ""vulnerable patient"" reached towards a police officer. The department said the police officer guided the patient back to their treating nurse, ""who returned the patient back to their area as per standard procedure"". Southern Adelaide Local Health Network CEO Kerrie Mahon told ABC News the incident was handled ""as per procedure and did not require escalation, or a report, to SAPOL"". ""There is never any hesitation in reporting a patient or incident to police if there are safety concerns,"" she wrote. ""We are committed to providing a safe environment for our staff and consumers."" According to Ms Mulholland, police were called to respond to a different patient who attended FMC's emergency department (ED) on Wednesday. She wrote that the patient was deemed ""too dangerous"" for the hospital's security workers to restrain. ""The staff and patients were in significant danger and there was nothing to be done but to allow the man to leave the ED for fear of physical harm to others in the ED,"" Ms Mulholland wrote. ""The police were called and the patient was restrained by STAR (Special Tasks and Rescue) Force officers and returned to the ED."" SA Police said it provided assistance at hospitals across the state when SA Health staff determined that additional training or resources were necessary to manage a situation. ""For this particular incident, SA Police would need more details to accurately identify and report on it,"" a spokesperson said. Ms Mulholland said following the incidents, one doctor asked for a stabbing vest for protection against ""highly aggressive patients"". She said over the past few weeks, several patients had threatened doctors and caused property damage in the emergency department. She said one patient ""headbutted"" one of the emergency department's airlock doors, smashing the glass, while another used a wet floor sign to smash a nurse's station window. ""[Doctors] believe we are only days, if not weeks away, from a significant incident,"" she told ABC News. ""I have not seen this level of violence before at the Flinders Medical Centre. ""It has reached the tipping point now where we actually need to do something about violence in our emergency departments because of long wait stays of many different types of patients, including mental health patients."" In a statement, SafeWork SA confirmed it received a report from Ms Mulholland on Monday outlining allegations of potential work, health and safety breaches at FMC. ""SafeWork SA will now review the report to determine whether the alleged contraventions are substantiated,"" a spokesperson said. ""Appropriate actions will be considered based on the findings."" Ms Mulholland said some of the violence was prompted by mental health patients, including people under the influence of methamphetamines, waiting up to 60 hours in the FMC emergency department for a bed. ABC News has asked SA Health to respond to SASMOA's allegations of work, health and safety breaches, mental health patient wait times, and concerns about drug-induced violence, but has yet to receive a response. SASMOA and the state government are currently negotiating on a new enterprise bargaining agreement, with the union threatening to strike over the government's pay offer."
Kayla's life was taken over by the government. She's gagged from speaking out,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/state-guardianship-australia-abuse-public-trustee-failure/105310740,2025-06-24,
Kerrie left hospital clutching medication. She died 36 hours later,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-23/kerrie-carroll-suicide-nsw-health/105415008,2025-06-23,"Kerrie Carroll devoted her life to caring for a menagerie of injured, neglected and abandoned animals. Warning: This story contains discussion of suicide. At the Lucky Stars Animal Sanctuary, which she founded in the New South Wales Southern Tablelands, Ms Carroll nursed everything from alpacas to wombats and even a bearded dragon back to health. But when the former nurse needed care from the NSW health system, it failed her. On October 19, 2023, Ms Carroll was rushed to Queanbeyan Hospital by paramedics after attempting suicide — her second attempt at taking her own life within weeks. What happened next was a litany of failures in her care, which are outlined in an internal review into her treatment by NSW Health. Within hours of Ms Carroll's suicide attempt, she was discharged from the emergency department, still clutching a bag containing some of the medication she had tried to overdose on. Just over 36 hours later, she would die by suicide. Ms Carroll's partner, Clint Seares, said he had concerns about her care in the overstretched emergency department at Queanbeyan Hospital from the start. ""The process felt rushed,"" he said. ""Kerrie was heavily sedated because of the medication she'd taken. They provided her with a psychological interview, which I didn't really feel was appropriate at the time, as I didn't really feel she was conscious enough to make informed choices."" In the wake of her death, a Serious Adverse Event Review (SAER) by NSW Health found that Ms Carroll was ""not fit for interview"" when she received a mental health assessment in the emergency department. The SAER report found ""the consumer remained sedated during the mental health assessment"". ""The mental health assessment undertaken … was sub-optimal and was not comprehensive, which may have led to her premature discharge."" Despite Ms Carroll's suicide attempts, the assessment ""did not include a detailed suicide risk assessment, psychosocial assessment, or management plan"". Mr Seares said he felt the nurse who conducted the interview asked leading questions. ""I was very disappointed and a little bit shocked,"" he said. ""It was almost like admission to a mental health ward was used as a punishment or a threat, rather than an opportunity for care. It was phrased in terms of 'you don't want to go to this place, do you Kerrie?'"" he said. The review also found that Ms Carroll was discharged without consulting a psychiatrist or senior mental health clinician, despite that issue being raised in a review into another Serious Adverse Event less than two years earlier. ""The team found [Kerrie Carroll] did present with significant safety concerns, which necessitated consultation with a psychiatry medical officer, which did not happen,"" it said. Staff at Queanbeyan Hospital also failed to inform Mr Seares when his partner was being discharged. Instead, he found her on a bench outside the hospital withleftover medication she had overdosed on that had been brought in by the paramedics who had rushed her to hospital. ""I couldn't understand how someone who had tried to commit suicide a few hours earlier was then basically put out onto the bench with the same medication, with a glass of water even."" The SAER found there had been only ""minimal staffing"" in the emergency department that afternoon because a number of staff had called in sick and Ms Carroll had been released without a proper discharge summary. The day after her release, the community mental health team assigned to follow up with Ms Carroll made a number of unsuccessful attempts to try to contact her by telephone. The SAER found that ""critically low"" staffing levels in the local community mental health team meant a neighbouring regional team had been asked to follow her case up virtually. By the time that team called an ambulance to conduct a welfare check, it was too late — Ms Carroll had made another attempt at suicide at her home. This time it proved fatal. Mr Seares is now taking legal action against NSW Health over Ms Carroll's death, speaking out onthe state's troubled mental health system. Mental Health Minister Rose Jackson said lessons would be learned from Ms Carroll's death. ""Of course my heart absolutely breaks for Kerrie's family; it's a deep tragedy, and obviously we send our sincere condolences, but more than that, a commitment to reflect on the circumstances that led to her death and try to make sure that it never happens again,"" she said. Ms Jackson said theSouthern NSW Local Health District had implemented the SAER's report's recommendations into Ms Carroll's death, including clarifying the need for a senior mental health clinician to be consulted before patients at serious risk of harm were discharged from the emergency department. The minister acknowledged many of the issues highlighted in the case were also raised in a recent Four Corners program, where former public psychiatrists described the pressure to discharge mental health patients without proper treatment. ""I could not be clearer in my expectation that everyone receives the highest quality care,"" she said. Ms Jackson said NSW, which spends the least per capita in Australia on mental health, was playing catch-up after a decade of underfunding. ""I see it as an urgent priority,"" she said, hinting to mental health investment in the upcoming 2025-26 NSW budget. But Mr Seares remains unconvinced, saying many of the cases highlighted by Four Corners bore remarkable similarities to his partner's experience. ""A culture that has an inability to learn is a really scary place to be,"" he said. ""NSW Health keeps on making the same errors and disastrous results because it's failing to learn. How many more people have to die like Kerrie before they're prepared to do something about it?"""
"As Australia's deepest copper mine calls time, what happens to Mount Isa?",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-21/copper-mine-to-close-mount-isa-future-uncertain/105398098,2025-06-21,"Dotted along an outback Queensland horizon, mining stacks rise from the red dirt below. Marking the epicentre of one of the richest mineral deposits in the world, these towering cylinders bear the residue of more than 100 years of blood, sweat and tears. For all that time, mining has sustained the city at its doorstep — Mount Isa. Eighteen months ago, Swiss commodity trader Glencore announced it wouldclose a significant portion of its Mount Isa Mines complex— the underground copper operation — by July this year. In that time, the company has reduced the expected redundancies from 1,200 to 500. But that hasn't eased the next big threat: to shutter other key assets if government doesn't intervene. Separated only by the width of a rail track, it's hard to distinguish where the Mount Isa Mines (MIM) complex ends and the community begins. It's always been that way. Prospector John Campbell Miles stumbled upon therocky outcrops that would become the city in 1923. A year later, Mount Isa was born. ""From those days, Mount Isa has always been fighting for our existence,"" local historian Kim-Maree Burton said. From company takeovers to stock market turmoil to industrial disputes, the local community has weathered each storm in its path. ""It's our character, regardless of the parental ownership, MIM is part and parcel of this city,"" she said. ""Could we have a city without the mine? I don't think so. Could we have the mine without the city? I don't think so. ""We're two peas in a pod, we need each other."" That's a sentiment shared by many of the 19,000 residents who call the place home. A born and bred Mount Isan, former local business owner Brett Peterson wasn't surprised when Glencore announced it was ceasing operations at the underground copper site. Threats to shutter other key assets like the copper smelter in Mount Isa and copper refinery in Townsville have stoked fears far and wide. ""I don't want Mount Isa to end up as a small town, there's too much happening here,"" he said. Mount Isa is home to one of only two copper smelters in Australia and is theonly one that can process third-party product. In countries like China and Indonesia, treatment costs are heavily subsidised by local governments. In a statement, Glencore interim chief operating officer Troy Wilson said the company could not keep up. ""Smelters and refineries like those in Mount Isa and Townsville must be able to compete internationally to survive,"" Mr Wilson said. The company admitted these assets could close ""this year if we cannot reach an agreement with the Queensland or federal governments."" Four-yearly maintenance on the copper smelter to thetune of $30 million is due in 2026. But Glencore is seeking a much larger bailout, making a pointed comparison to theWhyalla Steelworks, which received a $2.4 billion packagein February. Queensland Premier David Crisafulli has been vocal on the need for these assets to stay operational, but neither the state nor federal government has promised any solid funding yet. ""Mount Isa's been pretty good to Glencore over a long period of time, I think Glencore needs to be pretty good to Mount Isa now because that is a city on its knees,"" Mr Crisafulli told the ABC earlier in June. In a statement, a spokesperson for federal Minister for Industry and Innovation Tim Ayres said the Australian government was monitoring the situation and discussions were continuing. ""Closure of the smelter would have downstream impacts for a number of facilities … the Australian government will work with the Queensland government on the path ahead."" You only have to look at the remnants of once-bustling mining towns nearby to know what's at stake. The town of Mary Kathleen 50 kilometres from Mount Isa was born off the back of the uranium boom of the 1950s. At its peak, the community was entirely self-sufficient, with homes, a school, cinema, even an Olympic-sized swimming pool. But by 1982, when the ore deposit was exhausted, the town wasstripped bare and sold off at auction. Mount Isa's population is already projected to decline, and the city council is preparing for a worst-case scenario of 50 per cent if no other projects start up. But long-time residents are confident Mount Isa won't suffer the same fate as its neighbour. ""Mary Kathleen was totally different, it was a company town,"" Ms Burton said. President of Commerce North West Johno Neilsen points to Mount Isa's critical role as a service hub in the outback as proof the city will survive. ""We've got the largest hospital in the region; health is a major employer. ""That's the saving grace; there's a lot of industries that are still prevalent in town."" For Mr Peterson, the looming threat of further closures isn't enough to make him pack up and abandon the city he's lived in all his life. ""But we need to see some change on the horizon,"" he said."
Online safety authority wants YouTube included in social media ban,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/esafety-wants-youtube-included-in-social-media-ban/105453074,2025-06-24,"YouTube could be captured by the federal government's social media ban for children under 16, following advice from the eSafety commissioner to new communications minister Anika Wells. The video-streaming platform is slated to be exempt from the ban, which includes platforms such as TikTok and Instagram, which the government has said is because it can be used for educational purposes. But eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, who will address the National Press Club today, wants to reverse that exemption, arguing it is the platform doing the greatest amount of harm. Ms Inman Grant has pointed to new research conducted by eSafety, which found YouTube is used more than any social media platform the ban is targeting. ""It's almost ubiquitous that kids are on social media. By far the most prevalent social media site they're on is YouTube,"" she said. ""And when we asked where they were experiencing harm and the kinds of harms they were experiencing, the most prevalent place where young Australians experienced harm was on YouTube — almost 37 per cent. ""This ranges from misogynistic content to hateful material, to violent fighting videos, online challenges, disordered eating, suicidal ideation."" The research also found 70 per cent of children had encountered harmful content online. Platforms targeted by the ban had previouslyexpressed their deep concernsabout YouTube's exemption. Ms Inman Grant has written to federal Communications Minister Anika Wells, making a formal recommendation that YouTube be captured by the ban. She suggests in the letter both that YouTube has the characteristics of a platform that should be captured by the ban, and also that specifically carving out platforms by name could become problematic. The recommendation also notes that young people would still be able to access YouTube without a login, meaning some of the site's resources will still be available. A spokesperson for Ms Wells said the recommendation was being looked at. ""The minister is carefully considering the eSafety Commission's advice on the draft Social Media Minimum Age Rules,"" the spokesperson said. ""Her top priority is making sure the draft rules fulfil the objective of the Act — protecting children from the harms of social media."" YouTube has pushed back on the suggestions, urging the government to stick with its existing plan to exempt the platform. Rachel Lord from YouTube Australia and New Zealand said there is substantial evidence that YouTube is widely used in classrooms, and it enjoys broad support from parents. ""YouTube is not a social media platform; it is a video streaming platform with a library of free, high-quality content, and TV screens are increasingly the most popular place to watch,"" she said. ""We urge the Government to follow through on the public commitment it made to ensure young Australians can continue to access enriching content on YouTube."" Ms Inman Grant also wants more clarity for social media platforms seeking exemptions from the ban, arguing the current rules are too prescriptive. Under the current draft rules, platforms can be exempt because they are messaging apps, are used for online gaming, or have the ""primary purpose of supporting the health and education of end-users"". The draft rules go on to name YouTube separately as being exempt. In her letter to the minister, Ms Inman Grant said a new clause should be added to broadly exempt platforms that pose little risk. ""This would ensure that services which do not meet any of the proposed purpose/use tests, but are nonetheless safer and potentially beneficial for children, are carved out from the [social media ban] obligation,"" she said. ""Absent such a rule, eSafety would likely exercise discretion not to enforce compliance with the obligation for lower-risk services that are appropriate for young children in the absence of identified harm."" In her address to the National Press Club, Ms Inman Grant will outline other emerging threats, some of which could be addressed through the social media ban. Ms Inman Grant argues some of the most problematic aspects of social media platforms are features designed to encourage endless scrolling and maximum engagement, like tailored algorithms and push notifications. But she will also point to other risks like AI and chatbots as posing new threats. ""Just as AI has brought us much promise, it has also created much peril. And these harms aren't just hypothetical — they are taking hold right now,"" she will say, according to excerpts of her speech. ""In February, eSafety put out its first Online Safety Advisory because we were so concerned with how rapidly children as young as 10 were being captivated by AI companions — in some instances, spending up to five hours per day conversing with sexualised chatbots. ""Schools reported to us these children had been directed by their AI companions to engage in explicit and harmful sexual acts."" Last weekpreliminary findings of the government's age-assurance trial,which is exploring the feasibility of blocking young people from social media and adult websites, were delivered. Ms Inman Grant said that was one instance in which AI was providing a very valuable tool, and more work would be done to hone the eventual social media ban rules. Shadow communications minister Melissa McIntosh said the government is leaving it late to work out the detail of its ban, but has not expressed a view on whether YouTube should be included or not. “With just six months until these changes commence, it is disappointing the Government is only just now getting advice from the eSafety Commissioner,"" she said. “In or out, the Government needs to make its position clear on the requirements for social media platforms and families to protect our kids from the vitriol that is so prevalent online."""

Australia backs US strikes on Iran while urging return to diplomacy,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-23/australia-backs-us-strikes/105448088,2025-06-23,"Australia has given its support to US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities but has repeated calls for de-escalation to avoid a wider war. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Monday Australia was in favour of action to prevent Iran getting a nuclear weapon, echoing comments made earlier on Monday by Foreign Minister Penny Wong. ""The world has long agreed Iran cannot be allowed to get a nuclear weapon, and we support action to prevent that. That is what this is,"" the PM told reporters. The government initially adopted a more cautious tone, declining to give its explicit support. Senator Wong said Australia had not received a request for assistance and emphasised the US action was ""unilateral"" when asked whether Pine Gap, a shared military facility, had been engaged. While the PM and foreign minister declined to speculate on the response to any such request, Mr Albanese said Australia was ""deeply concerned"" about the prospect of escalation, placing the onus on Iran. ""We want to see diplomacy, dialogue and de-escalation … Iran had an opportunity to comply, they chose not to and there have been consequences of that,"" he said. Earlier, Senator Wong cited a UN watchdog finding that Iran had acquired enriched uranium at ""almost military level"". ""The key question for the international community is what happens next … It's obviously a very precarious, risky and dangerous moment the world faces,"" she said. The National Security Committee, comprised of key ministers, met in Canberra this morning. Australia's explicit expression of support for the strikes goes a step further than allies including the UK, Canada and New Zealand, although all three countries have emphasised the risk of Iran gaining nuclear weapons. The Coalition supported the strikes on Sunday and also says it does not want further war, but has put the onus on Iran to negotiate peace. ""We want to see Iran come to the negotiating table to verify where that 400 kilos of enriched uranium is,"" Andrew Hastie told ABC Radio National. Mr Hastie, who is acting as the opposition's foreign affairs spokesperson, said the Australian government had been ""flat-footed"" but he was pleased by the condemnation. ""I'm glad to see that Penny Wong has essentially endorsed our position and I'm glad we have bipartisanship on this,"" he said. Dave Sharma, a Liberal senator and former Australian ambassador to Israel, said the government's response was ""underwhelming and perplexing"" on Sunday and that support for the strikes ""should be a straightforward position for Australia to adopt"". The Greens are against the strike, with defence spokesperson David Shoebridge calling Donald Trump a ""warmonger"" and demanding Australia clarify it will not get involved. ""You cannot bomb your way to peace … and the people who are always going to pay the price are the ordinary people on the street,"" he said. Paul Foley, a former Australian ambassador to Iran, said Australia's response was ""appropriate"" but urged a return to diplomacy ""as rapidly as possible"". ""We're moving into uncharted territory … There's a range of factors to be balanced by the Australian and other governments,"" he said. Mr Foley speculated there were three categories of response from Iran — to do nothing, to launch a ""limited"" response, or to attack US assets or facilities in the region. ""A deal is still possible if both sides want one badly enough. President Trump came to office promising to be a peacemaker, and Iran also has indicated, in the past, a preference for going down the diplomatic path."" Senator Wong said Australian officials were stationed at the land border in Azerbaijan to assist any Australians seeking to depart Iran while airspace remained closed, urging them to leave if possible while acknowledging this was ""risky"". I understand this is a very difficult time for the Australian-Iranian community,"" she said. About 2,900 Australians in Iran and 1,300 in Israel have registered their desire to leave, and the minister said Australia would move to assist those in Israel to depart by air now that airspace was reopening. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Mr Trump via phone, emphasising the ""grave risk"" of Iran's nuclear program and placing the onus on Iran ""returning to the negotiating table as soon as possible"", according to a readout of the call. A joint statement from the UK, France, Germany and Italy urged Iran not to ""take any further action that could destabilise the region"" but did not include an explicit position on the strike. The New Zealand government has ""acknowledged"" the strike, and called for diplomacy, Foreign Minister Winston Peters saying ""ongoing military action in the Middle East is extremely worrying"". Canadian PM Mark Carney said Iran should not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon and that the US strike ""was designed to alleviate that threat"", but stopped short of explicitly endorsing it and called for ""all parties"" to return to the negotiating table."

Al Udeid Air Base hosts the US Central Command headquarters and is home to more than 11,000 US and Coalition service members. It is spread across 24 hectares in the desert, just outside Qatar's capital. The base is close enough for Doha residents to witness the flashes in the sky, as the country's air defences intercepted the wave of ballistic missiles. ""I live about 30km (from the base) ... So, it's not that far,"" Professor Kamrava told ABC Radio National. Iran's National Security Council said it targeted the base ""in response to the US aggressive and insolentaction against Iran's nuclear sites and facilities"". In its statement, the council said 14 missiles were launched, ""the same as the number of bombs that the US had used"". A US defence official said no one was hurt in the attack. Iran gave advance notice to the US and Qatari authorities hours ahead of the strikes. Qatar, which lies 190km south of Iran, said its ""air defences successfully intercepted the missile attack"". In a post on Truth Social, US President Donald Trump wrote that 13 missiles were intercepted and one missile was ""set free"" because it was not deemed a threat. US officials said medium-range ballistic missiles were used in the strikes. They were intercepted by US and Qatari Patriot air defence batteries, US Central Command said in a statement. Bases in Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE are protected by the US-developed Patriot missile batteries. The Patriot is a long-range missile defence system. Each Patriot battery consists of a truck-mounted launching system, a ground radar, a control station and a generator. They have eight launchers that can typically hold up to four missile interceptors each. The portable batteries can protect an area of up to 100km, and are commonly used to defend military sites. Dougal Robertson from defence firm Felix Advisory, who is a former intelligence officer for the Royal Australian Air Force, said Patriots were made to take out missiles. The number of missiles launched by Iran would have been ""pretty easy"" for the system to defend against. ""In this instance, it was a really relatively simple task for the Patriot,"" he told the ABC. ""Because of the low number of weapons, even if there had been no notice, the US would've been able to detect them quite quickly."" Before Israel launched Operation Rising Lion,Iran was believed to have the largest and most diverse ballistic missilestockpile in the Middle East. Israel said the goal of its strikes on Iran was to dismantle the country's nuclear program and ballistic missile stockpile. Ballistic missiles travel at high speeds, soaring to high altitudes before taking a deep and fast dive. This trajectory — going beyond the atmosphere before plummeting down to Earth — can make the missiles particularly difficult to intercept. Videos circulating online appear to show the remains of a Patriot PAC-3 missile following the defence against the Iranian attack. Mr Robertson said the Patriot PAC-3 was an advanced capability missile with greater guidance accuracy to directly hit ballistic missiles. It uses a ""hit to kill intercept"", striking the target at high altitudes and destroying it with kinetic energy. ""Generally, ballistic missiles are coming in at several times the speed of sound — sometimes up to about mach five — so you don't want to miss,"" he said. ""Being able to hit the target directly, it reduces the probability of missing the target. ""Generally, between two and three patriot missiles will be fired to ensure they hit a target."" Qatar also has the USTerminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. The THAAD was specifically designed for ballistic missile defence. US bases in the region have been on high alert and taking precautionssince the conflict between Israel and Iran erupted on June 13. And after the US strikes on Iran's nuclear sites over the weekend, Tehran warned that American assets in the region were ""legitimate targets"". US officials told Reuters that aircraft not in hardened shelters had been moved from Al Udeid base. And naval vessels had been moved from a port in Bahrain, where the military's 5th fleet is located. Mr Robertson said the US had an integrated system of defence across the region. If Iran attempted further strikes on US bases, it would be put into action. ""It involves ships in the Persian Gulf. It involves airborne assets. It involves land-based radar,"" he said. ""So, they know where the threat is coming from, and roughly the direction."" ABC/Wires"
Iran struck at 'American strength and pride'. Its missiles were shot down,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/iran-strikes-against-us-middle-east-targets-how-it-happened/105452590,2025-06-24,"US President Donald Trump is in Qatar. It'smid-May, 2025. He addresses troops at Al Udeid air base — thelargest US base in the Middle Eastand the launch point for air, sea, and intelligence missions. At the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the base hosted around 10,000 US soldiers. ""No visit in the Gulf would be complete without stopping to salute the people who keep America safe, strong and free,"" Mr Trump says. ""I am thrilled to be here with the men and women who embody American strength and pride."" Several weeks later,on June 13, Israel launches ""pre-emptive"" strikes against Iran, sparking a war between the two countries. Speculation about the potential of US involvement runs rampant. At2:10am Arabia Standard Time (AST) in Tehran (8:31am AEST) on June 22, that speculation is answered. The US military launches Operation Midnight Hammer, striking three Iranian nuclear sitesat Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. Iranian retaliation is expected. It's thought the United States's roughly 40,000 troops at some 19 military facilities across the region could be targeted. The Australian government updates its Smartraveller website atmidday on Monday, June 23, warning that ""the situation in the Middle East is unpredictable"". ""It could get worse with little warning. Security risks may increase,"" it says. The US Department of State issues a warning to people in Qatarat 2:45pm AST (9:45pm AEST). ""Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend American citizens shelter in place until further notice,"" it says. Britain also tells its citizens in the region to shelter in place. Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs at6:30pm ASTannounces it will temporarily close the country's airspace ""in order to ensure the safety of citizens, residents, and visitors"". The last plane to arrive into Doha is a Qatar Airways flight from Los Angelesthat lands at 6:31pm ASTaccording to flight tracking website Flightradar24. ""We neither initiated the war nor wanted it,"" Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian posts on social media at7:04pm AST. Qatari officials receive reportsaround 26 minutes laterthat missiles have been launched from Iran. Witnesses in Doha report seeing explosions in the sky. Iran's military, speaking on state television, says it has targeted US forces stationed at Al Udeid air base in Qatar. But the base was evacuated before the attack — and just one missile lands there, without causing any casualties. It's later confirmed that a total of 19 missiles were fired from Iran. As of7:55pm AST, Flightradar24 says Qatar and UAE airspace is still closed. Airspace over Bahrain and Kuwait is also closed temporarily. About 9pm AST, images of the Iranian missiles being intercepted over Doha start coming in. Qatar's Foreign Ministry issuesa statement at 9:17pm ASTcondemning Iranian strikes as ""a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the State of Qatar, its airspace, international law, and the United Nations Charter"". ""Qatar was one of the first countries to warn against the dangers of Israeli escalation in the region, and have consistently called for diplomatic solutions to be prioritised,"" it says. At9:37pm AST, the secretary-general of the Arab League — a 22-member confederation — slams Iran. ""I express full solidarity with the State of Qatar in the face of the unacceptable and condemned assault on its sovereignty and the violation of its airspace by Iran,"" says Ahmed Aboul Gheit, a former Egyptian foreign minister, on X. ""We remain hopeful that the current confrontation will be contained as soon as possible."" Speaking ontelevision at 11:21pm AST, a Qatari official says Iran's strikes are against the spirit of ""good neighbourliness"". Qatar reserves the right to ""respond in accordance with international laws and in accordance with the shape and size of this attack"". The spokesperson says the situation in Qatar is ""completely stable"" and life is going back to normal. ""Iran has officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response,"" Mr Trump says on his Truth Social platform at3:52pm, Washington time (10:52pm AST). ""I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured,"" he says. Mr Trump also thanks the Emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. ""Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same."" But there is no suggestion of wanting peace from Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who posts on X an hour later, at12:31am Tehran time (12:01am AST). ""Those who know the Iranian people and their history know that the Iranian nation isn't a nation that surrenders,"" he says. Another hour later, it's7:23am in Canberraand Australia is waking up. Foreign Minister Penny Wong condemns Iranian strikes, calling for ""de-escalation, dialogue and diplomacy"". By 7:51am —12:53am AST— Flightradar24 announces that Qatar airspace is back open and flights are landing again. Qatar Airways says it has deployed extra ground staff at Doha airport to support passengers. Mr Trump returns to Truth Social at6:02pm Washington time(1:32am AST) todeclare a ""complete and total"" ceasefirehas been reached between Israel and Iran. ""God bless Israel, God bless Iran, God bless the Middle East, God bless the United States of America, and GOD BLESS THE WORLD!"" Two and a half hours later, Iraqi media reports an unidentified drone strike at the Taji military base north of the country's capitalat 3:34am AST. No casualties are reported. US Vice-President JD Vance tells Fox News that — ""knock on wood"" — without a single American casualty, the Iranian nuclear program has been ""obliterated"". Experts have said it's too early to determine the extent of damage to Iran's nuclear capabilities. ""We need to talk to Iran and, of course, to Israel about what the future holds,"" Mr Vance says. Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi posts on X at3:46am AST, rejecting Mr Trump's claim of a mutually agreed ceasefire. But, he says, ""provided that the Israeli regime stops its illegal aggression against the Iranian people no later than 4 am Tehran time, we have no intention to continue our response afterwards"". ""The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later."""
These strikes look like an Iranian escalation. They're likely the opposite,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/irans-strikes-on-qatar-look-like-escalation-but-they-may-not-be/105452410,2025-06-24,"Iran has decided to retaliate to the US attack on its nuclear sites with a symbolic and overtly telegraphed strike that has caused no casualties. Iran gave advance notice that allowed the US base to be evacuated and Qatar's air defences to be prepared, with Patriot batteries in the Gulf state shooting down the Iranian missiles. From the outset Iran specified that it didn't attack ""the brotherly nation of Qatar"", only the huge US base it hosts at Al Udeid. In that, Iran may have misjudged Qatar. It has a very different relationship with Qatar to the near-client-state dominance it had over Iraq when it tried the same tactic there in 2020. ""We affirm that Qatar reserves the right to respond directly in a manner equivalent with the nature and scale of this brazen aggression, in line with international law,"" Qatar's government said. Other Gulf states were similarly angry, with Saudi Arabia placing ""all of its capabilities"" at Qatar's disposal. This is a huge step for a nation that eight years ago was reportedly considering invading its small neighbour (it instead imposed a three-year blockade, along with the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt). Qatar carefully builds alliances and influence and maintains difficult relationships, even with Israel. It will not appreciate Iran using it as a theatre for retaliation, even a symbolic one. Iran may have thought it was demonstrating to Gulf nations that there was a price for hosting US troops, but instead it has angered the countries that had been restoring ties and condemning the US and Israeli strikes. However, Iran appears to have correctly read the US in choosing this option of symbolic, rather than escalatory, retaliation — likely because it has done it before. In 2020 Iran struck US bases in Iraq in retaliation for the US assassination of senior general Qassem Soleimani. Iraq was given advance warning of the strikes, the Americans were ready (although many US personnel suffered blast trauma) and the US did not strike back. By avoiding casualties among US personnel at Al Udeid — a criteria Trump gave early in this new conflict for preventing US retaliation — Iran is hoping to signal it doesn't want further conflict with the US. The US looks like it is going to ""take the win"", as former president Joe Biden once said about an earlier round of Iranian strikes against Israel. Iran is clearly looking for an off-ramp and the US wants them to return, significantly weakened, to nuclear control negotiations. Nothing has so far dissuaded Israel, however, which is expanding its strikes to include Iranian military and security agencies that directly support the clerical regime. The US might say it wants the conflict to end in negotiations, without regime change, but Israel has given no sign that it is ready to stop."
"Zelenskyy calls Russia, Iran and North Korea 'coalition of murderers' during UK visit",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/zelenskyy-iran-north-korea-russia-coalition-of-murderers/105451908,2025-06-24,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has described Russia, Iran and North Korea as a ""coalition of murderers"" during a visit to the UK, in which he met with the British Prime Minister to discuss defence co-operation. Mr Zelenskyy was in London after a series of deadly strikes against Kyiv and as Keir Starmer prepared to meet with US President Donald Trump and other world leaders at a crucial NATO summit in the Netherlands on Tuesday. Mr Zelenskyy also met with King Charles III and senior members of the British government during the visit on Monday. The UK has been one of Ukraine's closest supporters since Russia's invasion began in February 2022, and more recently has led a push to create a ""coalition of the willing"" of countries willing to defend Ukraine's post-war sovereignty. Before landing in the UK, the Ukrainian president said he hoped to negotiate with the British government ""new and powerful steps to increase pressure on Russia for this war and to put an end to the strikes"". Waves of Russian drones and missiles in and around Kyiv overnight killed 10 people including one child, Ukrainian officials said on Monday. Mr Zelenskyy posted on social media that the latest onslaught was a warning to other countries neighbouring states like Russia, Iran and North Korea. ""Everyone in countries neighbouring Russia, Iran, and North Korea should be thinking carefully about whether they could protect lives if this coalition of murderers persists and continues spreading their terror,"" he posted on X. Mr Zelenskyy began his visit by shaking hands with the king at Windsor Castle, the third such time they have met since the start of this year. The palace said Mr Zelenskyy ""visited The King this afternoon and remained to luncheon"". He later met with senior members of the British parliament, including lower house Speaker Lindsay Hoyle. The Ukrainian leader also visited Downing Street for a bilateral meeting with Sir Keir. After the meeting, Mr Starmer announced an industrial military co-production agreement with Ukraine. ""I'm really proud that … we're able to announce an industrial military co-production agreement — the first of its kind so far as Ukraine and the UK are concerned — which will be a massive step forward now in the contribution that we can continue to make,"" he said. Mr Zelenskyy's visit to the UK came as Ukrainian cities continued to come under direct Russian attack. Russia has been launching near-daily drone and missile attacks against Ukraine in recent months, but their intensity has increased in recent weeks as talks to end the war have yielded few results. Mr Trump has been attempting to broker a peace between the two sides, but negotiations have so far yielded little progress, though prisoner exchanges have been agreed. Strikes in Kyiv overnight on Monday lit up the night sky, caused fires in residential areas and damaged the entrance to a metro station bomb shelter. At least 34 people, including four children, were wounded in the attacks on Kyiv, the emergencies service said. From midnight until almost dawn, the city shook with explosions and rattling machine gunfire from anti-aircraft units aiming at the drones. Ukraine's air force said it downed 339 of 352 drones and 15 of 16 missiles Russia launched during the attack on four Ukrainian regions. Rescue workers pulled bodies from the rubble of an apartment block in Kyiv's busy Shevchenkivskyi district, less than a kilometre from the US embassy. At least nine people died in the district, the interior ministry said. Valeriy Mankuta, 33, described clambering from his window to the third floor below to escape after his building was hit by what authorities said was a missile. Reuters photos showed several explosions above apartment buildings in the area. ""There were bricks on me, there was something in my mouth. It was total hell. I woke up in the rubble,"" Mr Mankuta said. ABC/Reuters"

Trump says Israel-Iran ceasefire 'is now in effect',https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/usa-donald-trump-announces-israel-iran-ceasefire/105452746,2025-06-24,"US President Donald Trump has announced Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire and that the war could be ""considered ended"" within 24 hours. This story is no longer being updated. For the latest news on the war,follow the live blog. But the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) continued alerting residents to incoming missiles right up until the reported ceasefire cut-off time. Earlier today, just after 8am AEST (6pm Washington time), Mr Trump posted on social media and said a ceasefire would begin at about 2pm AEST. ""It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE … for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED,"" he wrote. He said 24 hours after the ceasefire began, an ""official end"" to the war would be ""saluted by the world"". For about 2 hours after Mr Trump's announcement neither Israel nor Iran publicly responded, although the Reuters news agency said a senior Iranian official had confirmed the ceasefire. Then, at roughly 12pm, conflicting information emerged about whether Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on social media saying ""no 'agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations"" had been made. He added that if Israel stopped its attacks, Iran did not intend to continue its strikes. Minutes later, he followed up with another post that said Iran's military operations had ""continued until the very last minute"". ""Together with all Iranians, I thank our brave Armed Forces who remain ready to defend our dear country until their last drop of blood, and who responded to any attack by the enemy until the very last minute,"" he said. Meanwhile, local media in Iraq and Israel reported that Iran had agreed to the ceasefire on the condition it could carry out a final strike. Israel is yet to publicly comment on the ceasefire announcement. Iran continued firing waves of missiles at Israel after Mr Trump's announcement. Israeli residents were alerted to incoming rocket fire in the minutes after the ceasefire was due to begin, but according to Reuters, Iranian state media said the missiles were fired before the ceasefire came into effect. Israel's Magen David Adom, the national ambulance service, said four people had been killed in a strike in southern Israel. Shortly after 2pm AEST, Mr Trump posted on social media: ""THE CEASEFIRE IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!"" Mr Trump's announcement came just hours after Iran fired a barrage of missiles at a US military base in Qatar, in retaliation for the US bombing three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. Iran had notified Qatar of the attack on the Al Udeid base in advance, allowing time for its evacuation to prevent casualties. Mr Trump subsequently thanked Iran in a social media post, and described the attack as ""expected"" and ""very weak"". Iran and Israel have been trading missile fire since Israel attacked Iran on June 13, in what the Israel Defense Forces called a ""pre-emptive, precise, combined offensive … on Iran's nuclear program"". Israel's initial targets included military leaders and nuclear scientists. A senior White House official told Reuters that Mr Trump had brokered the ceasefire deal in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel had agreed so long as Iran did not launch further attacks. US Vice-President JD Vance said the war between Iran and Israel was effectively over, and it was time to ""restart a real peace process"" in the Middle East. ""We have to talk to Iran and, of course, to Israel about what the future holds because while we have obliterated the Iranian nuclear program, our hope and our expectation is that they're not going to try to rebuild that program,"" he told Fox News. Asked about an earlier social media post in which Mr Trump raised the prospect of regime change in Iran, Mr Vance said: ""I think what the president was saying … is if the Iranian people want to do something about their own leadership, that's up to the Iranian people."" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia welcomed the ceasefire announcement and had consistently called for ""dialogue, diplomacy and de-escalation"". ""The safety of Australians in the region is our priority,"" he said in a statement that was issued before Iran denied an ""agreement"" had been reached. ""We continue to closely monitor the situation in the Middle East and are deeply concerned about keeping Australians safe."""
"For all the noise around productivity, the solution may be obvious",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/productivity-ai-unemployment-problem/105448634,2025-06-24,"Just as the teeth-gnashing over our great productivity ""crisis"" is reaching a crescendo, the whole affair may be just about to solve itself. Ironically, the solution is likely to be centred around what's generally perceived as that other great existential threat, Artificial Intelligence. There's been so much noise about Australia's declining productivity in recent years, Treasurer Jim Chalmers has called for a roundtable discussion involving government, business and unions in August. Most of that noise has emanated either from those with an axe to grind or those who can't quite grasp the principle, let alone figure out if there is even a problem. Deceptively simple as a concept, productivity is devilishly complex when it comes to understanding the forces that impact it. That's why, even with a full-time Productivity Commission, and after years of debate, we're still really none the wiser. Much of the debate, wrongly, centres around tax. And, disappointingly, the August round table is likely to be dominated by gripes around tax instead of the emerging challenges of AI. ""I expect, I anticipate, I welcome tax being an important part of the conversation,"" Mr Chalmers told reporters last week ahead of an address to the National Press Club. But does Australia have a productivity problem? Not really, according to this graph from our very own Productivity Commission. Clearly, our productivity growth in the 15 years leading up to the pandemic was below the previous decade and a half. But that was the case in almost every other OECD country. And our performance was significantly better than the US, most of Europe, including the UK, and the OECD average. Given we appear to be on the cusp of the fifth industrial revolution — where we will work with smarter machines and artificial intelligence — there's every chance the productivity problem will evaporate over time. So maybe we should save ourselves all the angst. Just to put it into perspective, our productivity is growing, so it's not exactly a crisis. It's just growing at a slower pace than previously. Why? Well, it's not that clear, even though various vested interests will tell you otherwise. Perhaps developed nations' productivity grew in the 1990s because deregulation in the banking system during the 80s unleashed torrents of money and new investment. Unfortunately, that imploded in 1987 when Wall Street crashed, inflation took hold, interest rates soared and a brutal recession gripped the global economy. So, there was a downside too. Or, maybe, it was the sudden rise of computers and the internet. Those changes certainly improved communications and enabled workers to operate more efficiently, the very definition of productivity gains. But back in 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow was worried about it, prompting his now oft-quoted assessment of the then-burgeoning tech boom: ""You can see computers everywhere except in the productivity numbers."" His observation gave rise to what's now called the Productivity Paradox, which has had economists at each other's throats for decades. Some even dispute the existence of the paradox, claiming it all gets down to how you measure gains from innovation. The problem, they argue, is that innovation gains are counted""on an arithmetic scale when they should count on a logarithmic scale"". One explanation for the apparent mismatch is that it takes years for the productivity gains to show up. Firms in the early stage either overspend or invest in the wrong equipment and insufficiently train workers who then take time to become accustomed to new technology. Or maybe, it's just too difficult to measure in an economy that delivers services instead of producing widgets. Way back in the mists of time, back in January before DeepSeek rocked everyone's world with a highly effective AI model that cost a fraction of the American versions, Silicon Valley's tech giants figured they would spend around$US300 billion($470 billion) on Artificial Intelligence this year. So far, they're on track. But the biggest impact to date has been in the loss of jobs, not so much across the broader economy but in the tech world. It seems that AI is eating itself. Since the start of the year, tech firms across the globe have laid off more than 90,000 workers, many of them working in AI development, with more than two-thirds of those jobs evaporating in US firms at the forefront of the AI revolution. Intel, struggling under the weight of massive losses, is leading the pack, with Microsoft, Meta and Amazon all lightening their exposure to AI outlays. Amazon boss Andy Jassy last week warned further lay-offs were inevitable as the firm looked to replace workers with machines. There is now widespread fear that AI bots will displace large numbers of workers, leading to mass unemployment. Already, some business lobbyists are calling for greater ""flexibility"" within the workforce to enable businesses to more quickly and effectively adopt the new technology. That's code for making it easier to sack workers. But what they fail to recognise is that, unlike in previous times when machines took the place of unskilled workers, the rise of AI is threatening white-collar work. It is middle managers, professionals such as lawyers and accountants and possibly even lobbyists who trot out the same old lines year in and year out who may be in the firing line. It is the non-unionised, tertiary-educated sections of the workforce whose future is under threat and already, firms are cutting back on graduate intakes for their junior hirings. How many people lost their jobs when computers became part of the mainstream? Probably quite a lot. But the numbers aren't easy to find because the technology made many workers more efficient which, in turn, created new jobs. That's likely to happen again but it is likely to impact the upper echelons of the business world. AI is developing at a rapid pace. No longer is it simply scraping information off the internet for us and generating content — what is known as generative AI. It is now beginning to make decisions, in what's known as agentic AI. A recent study by Citigroup highlighted that this new incarnation, while similar to generative AI, has one important added feature. It can ""interpret goals, make decisions and act across workflows"". Banks already use a crude form of this for assessing loan applications and it will become more widespread for financial services businesses generally, including insurance and investment firms. Before long, these systems will infiltrate management systems more broadly. The Citigroup study asserts that these ""are no longer just tools, they are part of the process"". ""You're not just triggering a task, you're enabling systems to complete processes independently."" Australia's biggest bank, the Commonwealth Bank, isinvesting heavily in AI, as are most of our other major financial institutions. These changes are likely to revolutionise how we interact with each other commercially, speeding up processes and lifting productivity. But they will have major implications on how we work and particularly for our education system, to ensure future generations are adequately equipped to handle the challenges and opportunities. But don't expect to hear too much of this at the round table."
NSW budget reveals $1b plan making it easier to build new homes,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/nsw-budget-2025-26-announcements-housing-plan-developers/105451824,2025-06-24,"A $1 billion plan making it easier for developers to get finance and build new homes has been announced in the New South Wales budget. In an Australian first, the state will guarantee the pre-sale of up to 5,000 apartments, which it claims will allow developers to get finance to build 15,000 new homes over five years. The scheme is designed to combat the feasibility problems inhibiting development, as the state falls behind its targets for building homes. Treasurer Daniel Mookhey denied the initiative was merely a ""drop in the ocean"". ""This is a canny use of our state's balancing sheet,"" he said. The government was not expecting to be back in the black until the 2030s, but treasury is now forecasting $1.1 billion surpluses from 2027-28. ""I am cautious about it,"" the treasurer said. ""A lot needs to go right for us."" No new cost-of-living measures were announced on Tuesday, but $1.2 billion in spending on child protection was unveiled. The allowance paid to foster carers will increase by 20 per cent, and 44 homes for vulnerable children will be built or upgraded. ""This budget contains the biggest increase in funding for out of care home in New South Wales history,"" Mr Mookhey said. The 2024-25 deficit is projected to hit $5.7 billion, which is further in the red than anticipated in the half-yearly review. The treasurer blamed the downward revision on the ballooning cost of the workers compensation scheme, which the government has so far failed to reform. The effect of proposed cuts to the scheme, which have been blocked in parliament by the opposition and the crossbench, is not included in budget forecasts. ""This is not a good use of public money,"" Mr Mookhey said. ""It is incumbent on the Liberal party to explain why this is a good use of public money."" Leo Patterson Ross, the chief executive officer of the Tenants' Union of New South Wales, said the scale of the guarantee scheme was insufficient. ""We're talking about a shortfall of hundreds of thousands of properties, and properties that are affordable, genuinely affordable, to the people looking,"" he said. Mr Patterson Ross said it was a shame the government did not repeat itsspending in last year's budgeton building social housing. However, the Property Council of Australia's NSW executive director, Katie Stevenson, praised the policy. ""We must try new things. And this is a great example of the Minns government responding directly to the challenges that industry have raised,"" she said. But Ms Stevenson said more work was needed to remove other obstacles to building homes. ""Our research shows up to 40 per cent of the cost of a new development is state and local taxes and charges, which is a significant impost for development. And in some cases, that's holding back the ability for those projects to get started."""
"From Frankston to Scotland, Sione is plotting the Wallabies' downfall",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/sione-tuipulotu-rise-to-british-and-irish-lions-series-wallabies/105452530,2025-06-24,"Watching Australian Sione Tuipulotu playing for the British and Irish Lions should make the Wallabies wince. But lasting regrets would belie Tuipulotu's rise from rugby backblocks to international fame. His feats deserve comparison to trailblazers like Ange Postecoglou, Minjee Lee, and Jordan Mailata. ABC Sport will have live blog coverage of the British and Irish Lions' tour of Australia this July and August. Two generations ago, Tuipulotu's family was Scottish, Tongan, and Italian. His grandmother, Anne Thompson, moved with her parents and siblings from Greenock, outside Glasgow, to North Frankston (known as The Pines), an hour's drive from Melbourne, in 1963. Her daughter, Angelina, whose father was Italian, met Fohe Tuipulotu while he was studying at RMIT in Melbourne on an AusAID scholarship from Tonga. They married and moved to Tonga before returning to Australia to raise five children: two girls, Kiesse and Keanna, and three boys, Sione, Mosese and Ottavio. Sione played soccer while attending St Francis Xavier Primary School in Frankston. His childhood was spent in the Australian football heartland, where few people knew or cared about the differences between rugby and rugby league. The ranking of football codes in popularity was Australian Rules — daylight — soccer, rugby league and rugby. Sione was in his first year at the public high school Elisabeth Murdoch College when he decided to try rugby at Southern Districts, a family club in nearby Seaford — a world away from the private school programs in Sydney and Brisbane. But 'Souths' had everything children needed to improve their skills and showcase natural abilities. Fohe put up his hand to coach. Sione recently sent a video message to his old friends: ""I just want to say how much I miss it (Souths),"" he said. ""I've played for quite a few teams now, but I've never had more fun than when I played for Souths. I hope me and my brothers (Mosese and Ottavio) can all go back there one day and finish off our careers playing for Souths."" Fohe Tuipulotu said he had always promised he would help get his boys to the top. ""When we changed from soccer I was playing rugby here and I knew a lot of people in the sport anyway,"" he said. ""We went to Southern Districts because the coach at the time — he coached me in Powerhouse (a more prominent rugby club in Melbourne) back in the day. From there, it was obvious (Sione was a standout). ""When they (his sons) decided to play rugby, I promised them I would help them to get to the top. Obviously, the plan at the start was for them to play for either Australia or Tonga."" Southern District's club president Karl Dix recalled refereeing many of Sione's junior games. ""When he got the ball you knew he was going to break the line,"" Dix said. Sione and Mosese briefly joined their father in the senior team. The Tuipulutos' speed, power, and game sense also made them automatic selections in state underage carnivals. Private school St Kevin's College Toorak awarded Sione a scholarship in Year 9 and his brothers followed him to that school. ""It was a massive opportunity at the time,"" Fohe said. Sione played for the Australian Schoolboys and Junior Wallabies (Australia Under 20) for three consecutive years, 2015-17. He became the first Victorian to debut for the Melbourne Rebels. Turmoil was caused in Australian rugby next season when the Western Force folded and many of its players came across the continent to play Super Rugby for the Rebels. Sione's opportunities became scarce. ""He was doing really well,"" Fohe said. ""That's when things changed. He was sitting on the bench and the team was already beaten by 40 points, 50 points, and they only gave him five minutes. ""I can understand for a young kid, who has been good, good, good, good, and then he's hitting that kind of wall. It's going to be hard, mentally."" Fohe's advice to his son was to stay with the Rebels and keep trying. ""At the time, for me personally, I like to fight. Stay there and fight,"" he said. ""And that's what I told him to do. I didn't realise his mental health was affected at the time. ""But he didn't tell me because he wanted to respect my decision, which is a learning curve for me now."" A circuit breaker came for Sione in 2018 with the acceptance of an invitation to play in Japan during the off season. After a frustrating stretch with the Rebels he enjoyed the two-month experience, and Yamaha Jubilo (now Shizuoka Blue Revs) liked Sione so much that they wanted him to stay. ""He rang me up to come and see him and I knew there was something up,"" Fohe said. ""And he asked me to let him go. He had an offer to go back to Japan and play for them full-time. They offered him two years. He was struggling."" With Fohe's blessing, Sione stayed with the Japanese club and his game, and confidence, grew. ""Those two years that he went and played in Japan he played every single game for 80 minutes,"" Fohe said. ""And I saw the improvement in his game and I saw it quick. I think that was when Scotland was looking at him."" UK officials had witnessed Sione playing for Australia's under-20s at the World Cup in Manchester in 2016, with the knowledge that his grandmother was a Scot. ""I met some of the coaching staff from Scotland at the time,"" Fohe said. ""But our focus wasn't in Scotland, our focus was for them to grow up here and play for Australia."" Five years later, Sione said yes to an offer from Glasgow Warriors. The big move into the Scottish national team came via a phone call from the coach Gregor Townsend. Sione made his debut for Scotland against his father's homeland, Tonga, in 2021. Three years later he was made captain for a series that would include the Scottish debut of his brother Mosese, who had been following Sione through the ranks. ""The most emotional phone call I've ever had was Gregor phoning me to tell me I'll be Scotland captain,"" Sione told Scottish media. ""But when he phoned to say my brother would be included, that was a pretty close second."" The Tuipulotu brothers opposed Australia at Murrayfield Stadium, winning 27-13. Their grandmother made the trip from Frankston to be in the grandstands. ""It was an amazing moment,"" Sione told the BBC. ""When she handed over the cup she said, 'you got 'em!'. I'm super happy and it makes the day all worthwhile."" The youngest Tuipulotu brother, Ottavio, represented the Junior Wallabies in 2024. ""It's unbelievable,"" Fohe said. ""Because all of them play professional now. I knew the quality of how he (Sione) is and that determination — I knew he was going to go all the way. ""To see him grow not only with his rugby but his family life, for me as a father is very humbling."" Grandmother Anne, 77, was not much of a sports watcher until her three grandsons took up rugby. ""I thought they were the bee's knees when they were little — very cute and very funny,"" she told ABC Sport. ""It's very exciting to watch them playing and to be at the games."" Sione and his partner, Lara, had a son last year and named him Fohe Junior. ""I told them (his sons) that they have gone to represent their mum's side,"" Fohe Snr said. ""Their kids belong to me — that's the deal. I'll pick Australia or Tonga."" Sione made his British and Irish Lionsdebut in a loss to Argentina on Sunday morningin the midfield with New Zealand-born Irish champion Bundee Aki. His whole family will watch the series against Australia with typical humility and pride. Fohe and Angelina now live in Williamstown, a long drive from Frankston, but not all that far from the Melbourne Cricket Ground, where the Lions and Wallabies will play the second Test on July 26."
Aussies make bright start to Wimbledon qualifying,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/aussie-make-bright-start-to-wimbledon-qualifying/105452748,2025-06-24,"Li Tu is the pick of the first wave of Australians in Wimbledon qualifying, knocking out Colombian Daniel Galan, the fourth seed, 6-3 6-2. Galan is ranked number 122 in the world, 46 places higher than Tu, and made the last 16 at Wimbledon two years ago before running into Jannik Sinner. But the 29-year-old from Adelaide played excellently to take the first step towards his first main draw appearance at the grass court grand slam. Joining him in the second round will be Tristan Schoolkate, James McCabe and Alex Bolt, who all won the first of three matches they will need to negotiate to make the Wimbledon main draw. Recent Ilkley Trophy winner Schoolkate had to work harder than expected against Argentine world number 198 Facundo Diaz Acosta before coming through 6-7 (4-7), 6-1, 6-3. Bolt had a simpler Monday afternoon at Roehampton, putting away Frenchman Harold Mayot 6-3, 6-4. McCabe had a 6-4, 7-5 win over Borna Gojo of Croatia. There was heartbreak for Jason Kubler, who was due to face a British wildcard ranked 943rd in the world. Shortly before he was due to face Oliver Bonding, Kubler had to withdraw due to a right knee injury. There was disappointment too for Omar Jasika, who fell to Czech 15th seed Dalibor Svrcina 6-1 6-2. World number one junior Emerson Jones will lead Australia's women's qualifying challenge, which begins on Tuesday. Jones, who reached the Australian Open and Wimbledon junior finals last year, is joined in the draw by Talia Gibson, Priscilla Hon, Daria Saville, Astra Sharma, Destanee Aiava, Maddison Inglis, Lizette Cabrera, Arina Rodionova and Taylah Preston. Thirteen Australians — eight men and five women — already have a place in the main draws, among them James Duckworth and Aleksandar Vukic who meet at the Eastbourne Open on the south coast on Tuesday (local time).

Paro refuses to 'chase ghosts' as he sets sight on American rematch,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/liam-paro-prepares-for-boxing-showdown-with-jonathan-navarro/105453958,2025-06-24,"A validated Liam Paro is eyeing bigger targets, saying he will not ""chase ghosts"" and fight George Kambosos Jr. The Australian is instead intent on arematch with his conqueror Richardson Hitchins, ideally for multiple belts, as he prepares to fight on home soil for the first time in nearly three years. The Mackay product (25-1) will headline Wednesday's boxing card in Cairns against the dangerous Jonathan Navarro (18-1). Caboolture's two-time world title challenger Liam Wilson (15-3) will also feature against Argentinian super featherweight Ayrton Gimenez (22-1) as he eyes a rematch with Emanuel Navarrete after his controversial loss two years ago. Paro upset Subriel Matias in Puerto Rico towin the IBF's super lightweight title last Juneand, when a homecoming bout with Kambosos Jr did not eventuate, was forced to return there and defend his belt against Hitchins in December. The Brooklyn star won a split decision contest and then, as forecast by Paro, obliterated Kambosos Jr in New York City in his first defence earlier this month. ""I copped heat for saying George would lose, but I stand by it,"" Paro said. ""I just never thought Kambosos was world class. That's not unpatriotic. It's just my opinion as someone who knows what that level really looks like. ""There are levels to this game and I've shared the ring with the elite and I call it how I see it."" Kambosos is 2-4 since upsetting Teofimo Lopez in 2021 but has retained a top-four IBF ranking alongside Paro, who is also well positioned for shots at the WBC and WBO belts. ""I doubt it happens,"" Paro said of fighting his countryman. ""I think ego gets in the way. He's made it clear he won't fight another Aussie, which says a lot. ""But if we're both seen as one and two in the country, there's only one way to settle it. ""If it ever makes sense, I'm all in. I'll fight anyone, anywhere, but I won't chase ghosts."" Lopez currently owns the WBO strap and is on Paro's hit list, which includes Ryan Garcia, Rolando Romero and Isaac ""Pitbull"" Cruz. Paro's last win in Australia was a devastating first-round stoppage of Brock Jarvis that launched him towards his first title shot while signed to Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing. AAP"
Aussie number one blown off course as Wimbledon looms,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/daria-kasatkina-out-as-maya-joint-wins-first-round-eastbourne/105452460,2025-06-24,"Daria Kasatkina's miserable build-up to Wimbledon has continued with the Australian number one's defence of her Eastbourne title blown away in the first round, as much by the windy conditions as her opponent, Lulu Sun. The world number 11 served up 11 double faults as she was beaten 7-5, 2-6, 6-3 on the English south coast, her high ball toss vulnerable to the swirling gusts that made both players look foolish at times. But there is a better Wimbledon outlook for Maya Joint who gained her first win of the grass court season by beating three-time grand slam finalist Ons Jabeur, 7-5, 6-2. If not quite a boilover — both players are now ranked in the 50s — Jabeur has far more experience than the Queensland-based teenager, having reached the Wimbledon final in 2022 and 2023. Kasatkina's defeat means she has lost all three matches on grass since reaching the last 16 on the red clay of Roland-Garros. ""The conditions are very tricky. The ball is swirling around so anything can really happen, you have to keep fighting,"" Sun said. Devonshire Park is barely an over-hit forehand from the beach and the flags cracked with the stiff breeze as seagulls fought with the currents overhead. The conditions made for a topsy-turvy match, with New Zealander Sun racing into a 4-0 lead, only for Kasatkina, the number one seed, to roar back with five straight games. But at 5-4, she failed to press home a set point and Sun won the next three games to take the set in just under an hour. This despite a moment of brilliance when she returned a lob on the turn with a superb forehand pass. Kasatkina, who will be representing Australia for the first time in a grand slam at Wimbledon, having switched allegiance from Russia in March, responded impressively, snagging the second set in 36 minutes. She then broke in the fifth to take a 3-2 lead but Sun, who only served two double-faults, took the next three games and the match to move into the last 16 of the WTA 250. Kasatkina has now lost to players ranked 50 (Sonay Kartal at Nottingham), 49 (Xinyu Wang at Queen's) and 46 (Sun). While Sun is a useful grasscourt player who reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon last year, she had lost five of her last six matches and had not beaten a player in the top 250 since April. Following Kasatkina on court was Australian number two Joint, who took a 2-0 lead against Jabeur, but then found herself 2-3 down. However, winning her maiden title in Morocco recently has boosted her belief, and she soon broke back to be 4-4 before taking the set 7-5. Once she broke midway through the second set, the result was never in doubt. ""I was really happy to win my first title in Rabat, that was on clay so a bit different to grass, but I am learning to love this surface. [The Rabat title] gives me confidence coming in here,"" Joint said. ""I take a lot from my previous successes."" Aussie number three Kim Birrell plays American Sofia Kenin first up on Tuesday."
'Australians don't eat enough legumes': How to get the fibre you need,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-23/dietary-fibre-digestion-what-to-know-tiktok/105433084,2025-06-23,"People share a lot of their lives on social media. This can even include digestion details, with content about ""staying regular"", bloating and fibre far from off limits on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok. Food and nutrition scientist Emma Beckett, based in Newcastle/Awabakal, says she is glad these conversations are bringing fibre into focus. ""I feel like lately everything's aboutprotein and prioritising protein, and we've kind of forgotten about everything else, including fibre,"" she says. ""Talking about digestive health — particularly pooping — was very taboo for a long time."" Dr Beckett saysfibre falls into two major categories, soluble fibre and insoluble fibre. She sayssoluble fibre""forms a gel-like substance when it's mixed with water"". This gel-like consistency ""helps us to feel fuller for longer"" and some soluble fibres can also be classified as prebiotics, which help feed beneficial gut bacteria. According to Australia's public health websiteHealthdirect, soluble fibre isfound in oats and barley, fruit and vegetables. It's also found inlegumes such as chickpeas, lentils and beans. You may have heardinsoluble fibre described as roughage. ""I remember at school being told that fibre is like the gut's toothbrush,"" Dr Beckett says. Insoluble fibre is found in high-fibre and wholegrain breads and cereals, the outer skins offruits and vegetables and nuts and seeds. TheAustralian dietary guidelinesrecommend 30 grams of fibre a day for adult men and 25 grams for women. Dr Beckett says while fibre falls into two main categories (and even more subcategories), dietary recommendations are based on general fibre intake. Considering daily recommendations and how often we eat, she says meals with 10 grams of fibre or more are a ""fibre superstar"", and 6 to 10 grams is a ""good source"". However, Dr Beckett saysprioritising ingredients with fibre is more practicalthan ""obsessing over the grams"". ""If you're having vegetables in your lunch and your dinner, if you're eating as many legumes as possible, if you're eating as many whole grains as possible, then you don't even need to worry about the number."" Vincent Ho is a gastroenterologist and associate professor of medicine at Western Sydney University, and says patients are often confused about which foods are high in fibre. Dr Ho saysa supplement is not enough to get your recommended daily intake, with a tablespoon of psyllium husk only containing about 2 grams of fibre. Megan Rebuli is a research dietician in health and biosecurity at the CSIRO in Adelaide, on the traditional country of the Kaurna people. If you're looking to get more fibre at mealtimesyou can make some simple swaps, she says. ""For example, swapping white bread for wholegrain bread [or] swapping white pasta for wholegrain pasta."" You can also add legumes to salads and curries, she says. Dr Beckett says""generally speaking,Australians don't eat enough legumes"" and they're a ""stand-out"" when it comes to high-fibre foods. Dr Beckett says these recipes contain more than 10 grams of protein per serve. Dr Beckett says ""one of the immediate consequences of not having enough fibre in your diet is constipation."" This could lead to extreme discomfort and even haemorrhoids from straining, she says. What's considered normal frequency for a bowel movement varies person to person and ""it could be anywhere from three times a day to three times a week"". Dr Ho says constipation can also lead to anal fissures (small tears around the area) ""exacerbated by constipation and straining"". He says eating fibre can help reduce cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and alsoreduces the risk of colorectal cancer (also known as bowel cancer). If you're not getting enough, ""your cholesterol levels and your blood sugar levels can be elevated"", as well as your cancer risk. Ms Rebuli says being physically active and consuming dietary fibre has been shown to decrease your risk, but there are a range of lifestyle and genetic factors that may also play a part.

'Passenger parenting' leaves dads on backfoot and mums carrying the load,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-22/what-is-passenger-parenting-can-it-be-overcome/105399006,2025-06-22,"Parenting is an intense ride and always being the one in the driver's seat can take its toll. And having someone firmly entrenched as passenger can actually be damaging for both partners and the relationship. Recent research found that in heterosexual relationships, where it is mums most often taking the wheel, some dads can experience a phenomenon labelled ""passenger parenting"". The term was coined by Norma Barrett, the study's co-author and lecturer in public health and health promotion at Deakin University in Warrnambool, on the traditional lands of the Gunditjmara people in regional Victoria. She explains that while fathers are becoming increasingly engaged in daily family life, the persistence of a gendered norm means some feel on the ""outskirts"" when it comes to parenting decisions. And parenting alongside a passenger parent isn't easy, says Carly Dober, a psychologist and policy coordinator at the Australian Association of Psychologists. She says mothers who are carrying the lion's share of caring responsibilities because the men in their lives are not participating more may feel burdened. ""It can be really stressful if you do feel you are the default parent and wearing the emotional and cognitive load of all decisions,"" she says. So, what can you do if you're stuck in a driver-passenger parent dynamic? And, because passenger parenting can look a lot like weaponised incompetence, we explain the difference. While some dads Ms Barrett spoke to were ""happy to go with the flow"" and be led by their partner, most wanted to fully share the whole experience but felt ""shut out"" from doing so. She says the ""sidekick"" parenting role often begins for practical and social reasons. For example, it's most often mothers who take time off to care for the baby. ""There are physical reasons for that [being the birthing parent], and also if the baby is being breastfed then naturally it will be the mother that is going to do that,"" Ms Barrett says. Dads may have little to no time off before returning to work, and the parent spending the bulk of the time with the child becomes ""specialised"" in the gig of parenting. Ms Dober says dads might feel like they are not as equipped to do things like dress the child, how and when to feed the child, and what health appointments they need, for example. Some men in Ms Barrett's research expressed passenger parenting had a negative impact on their relationships. ""They are trying to be more involved in decision making, like around caring for the baby, feeding the baby, trying to be part of it, and if struggles were arising, coming up with solutions — but not always feeling like they knew the right language or approach. Fathers can get stuck in their passenger role beyond the transition into parenthood, explains Ms Barrett, because even when mothers might return to work and the caring load should equalise, dads haven't had the same ""parenting boot camp"", leaving them on the backfoot. Do you feel like the passenger parent in your family? Or perhaps you're tired of always being the one in the driver's seat. Share with us atlifestyle@abc.net.au Ms Dober says while some women may be happy to take a leadership role in parenting, others may feel there is a pressure to be the ""expert parent"". Whether it's a role they are comfortable with or not, it can be a difficult one to fulfil, with consequences for their wellbeing,career, and financial future. If current working patterns continue, the average 25-year-old woman today who goes on to have one child can expect to make$2 million less in lifetime earningscompared to the average 25-year-old man who also becomes a parent. Research also shows twice as many women as men experience parental burnout, due to the fact women still carry70 per centof the family mental load. ""There are so many micro decisions in the day-to-day of parenting that really do add up — an infinite amount of decision to make,"" Ms Dober says. The relationship can be impacted if women feel they aren't supported, she says. ""There might be resentment if you perceive your passenger parent is just deferring to you because they can't be bothered or prefer you managing it."" In intimate partner relationships, weaponised incompetence is often evident in the division of domestic tasks and caring labour. It is when someone ""demonstrates helplessness, real or false, in order to avoid certain tasks or responsibility, thus making other people [often their partner and/or co-parent] feel they have to step in and do it for them,""Ms Dober told us for a previous article. What makes passenger parenting different is intent, she explains. ""Weaponised incompetence is when you might be trying to gain more spare time to rest, socialise, or just tend to your own needs versus those of the family. ""Passenger parenting is feeling like you have less agency. There isn't malicious intent — although it can look the same depending on some behaviours."" Ms Dober says passenger parents will feel like they are missing out on something, and can ""take a beating to their self-esteem"". Parenting expert and dad to six daughters Justin Coulson says while some dads are ""happy to take a back seat"", in his experience, men overwhelmingly want to be more involved. While there are societal and structural barriers to reaching equality in co-parenting relationships, such as making itmore viable for dads to take parental leave, there are some ways individuals can work towards improvement. Dr Coulson recommends couples have weekly check-ins. ""On a Sunday morning when things are relatively quiet, my wife and I sit down and ask three questions. First, 'What's going well?' And we just take a minute to bask in the sunshine of success."" Secondly, they ask ""What hasn't worked this week?"" ""It's not a finger-pointing exercise, rather saying 'I've struggled here', of 'I could have done with more support on Wednesday night when three things were happening at once',"" Dr Coulson says as an example. Lastly, ""What could we work on this week?"" ""And the critical part of that is put together a plan to make that happen,"" he says. While Ms Barrett's research recommended couples have conversations early on about their parenting expectations, Ms Dober says those can change over time. She says parents can regularly touch base on what they would like to do more, or less of. For dads who feel like they don't have agency, that might be expressing what they would like to have more expertise in, or what challenges they think could benefit them in learning to do more? Ms Dober says parents need to be kind to themselves, and each other. ""Understanding that parenting is hard — you're both on this journey together, and figuring out what parenting looks like for your family. ""And that might be different to others, and to how you grew up."""
Slow-cooker bolognese is the ultimate hands-off dinner,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-21/easy-slow-cooker-bolognese/105229440,2025-06-21,"It's rare to find the time to stand over a pot, sautéing everything that goes into a bolognese, only to wait a few hours for the flavours to really hit the chorus and truly sing! Enter this version: no stirring required (except for a final mix at the end). Just layer it up, set it to low, and let time do the work. This bolognese is all about patience and pure alchemy. The vegetables are blitzed with a holy trinity of umami: tomato paste, Parmesan, and Worcestershire sauce. It's layered between the broken-up duo of pork and beef mince, which sits untouched so it naturally clumps and falls apart as the tension eases from the simmering sauce. The 15–20 hour slow cook isn't just for show — it's the secret to deep, slow-developed flavour. Put it on late Sunday night, and by Monday evening, you've got a perfectly timed meal ready to go."
Four cooks share their secrets to the perfect winter roast,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-20/secrets-to-the-perfect-winter-roast/105430380,2025-06-20,"There's something comforting about the smell of a roast wafting through the house on a chilly day. It's an investment of time and ingredients, which can make it daunting. Chefs and cooks share their tips and tricks to nail the perfect winter roast at home, from meats to vegetarian options. If you ask chef Matt Golinski, based on the Sunshine Coast/Kabi Kabi lands, there is nothing easier (or tastier) during winter than aslow-roasted lamb shoulder. ""Really, all you're doing is just throwing it into a tray,"" he says. ""It's probably simplest bit of cooking you'll ever do."" He recommends: If you love a good pork crackling and are a beginner, try chef and cookbook author Hayden Quinn'scrispy pork shoulder with green apple slaw. He recommends: Nipun Liyanapathirana creates cooking videos for social media and adds a tasty twist to a traditional beef roast. While you're not cooking a whole chunk of meat, his Sri Lankan spiced beef roast (similar to the popularKerala beef fry) is ""hearty, comforting, and full of depth and flavour"". ""It gives you the same exact finish as a typical roast, but the preparation and techniques used is completely different,"" he says. His technique means the meat is unlikely to be overcooked. He recommends: Alice Zaslavsky, a cookbook author and host of A Bite To Eat with Alice, has previously shared her favourite tips for theperfect roast chickenwith ABC Lifestyle. Her favourite method is ""the dry-and-hot"" (dry brine and hot oven). She recommends: Vegetarians and vegans fear not, Hetty Lui McKinnon has many recipes for veggie-forward winter roasts that she has shared with us previously. ""I remember a time when the non-meat option on a feasting table was lentil loaf,"" the food writer and cookbook author says. ""Luckily, food has evolved, and a show-stopping vegetarian main can now be as exciting as anything else on the table."" She recommends: She has recipes for astunning roast butternut pumpkinand awhole roasted red cabbage with a maple glaze, which can become the star of your next meat-free celebration table."
"Jane Austen rom-com makes cheeky nods to Bridget Jones, Hugh Grant",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/jane-austen-wrecked-my-life-review/105448396,2025-06-24,"Thirty-something-year-old Parisian bookseller Agathe Robinson (Camille Rutherford, Anatomy of a Fall) is an old soul; a hopeless romantic who isn't interested in ""uber sex"" but the romantic courtship of a bygone era. The star of Jane Austen Wrecked My Life, (written and directed by Laura Piani), Agathe is an Anglophone who buries herself in classics — Jane Austen chief among them. She also lives, with her sister and nephew, in an emotionally suspended state. An unspecified trauma lies at the heart of Agathe's existence that explains how she came to be this way and, gradually, we find out what the incident is that splintered her life in two. What:A quaint but emotionally slight rom-com with an old-world feel, written and directed by Laura Piani. Starring:Camille Rutherford, Charlie Anson, Pablo Pauly Where:In cinemas now Likely to make you feel:Charmed Agathe is a daydreamer with a penchant for writing love stories in her spare time. The comfortable monotony of her life is up-ended when her womanising co-worker and best friend, Felix (Pablo Pauly) — with whom she shares a platonic if overfamiliar kinship — applies on her behalf to the prestigious Jane Austen Writing Residency in southern England. She's successful, and it changes the course of her life. Agathe suddenly finds herself not only with the luxury of time and a room of her own to write, but she becomes the recipient of two men's affections: Felix, who she spontaneously kisses as she leaves France, and the thorny Oliver (Charlie Anson), the great-great-great-great nephew of Jane Austen herself, who manages the residency. Hijinks ensue in the bucolic greenery of a small England coastal town as the characters oscillate seamlessly between French and English. There are language mishaps, accidental nudity in the vein of The Proposal, and a ball right out of an Austen novel. Agathe is ensconced in an English manor (though the the film was shot entirely in France) straight out of the novels she devours, and is being romanced in the way she so greatly desires — through pithy one-liners, disarming honesty and genteel manners. But there's a snag. Felix surprises Agathe by showing up unannounced right before the ball, and Agathe has a decision to make. There's a little bit of Notting Hill in Agathe's vocation of bookselling (shared with Hugh Grant's William Thacker), though Paris's famed Shakespeare and Company is a more earnestly romantic backdrop than a bookstore that exclusively sells travel books. There's also a bit of Bridget Jones in the tragicomedy of Agathe's love life, and a sprinkling of Emily Henry's Book Lovers in the enemy-to-lovers scenario that plays out in a literary world. The film employs numerous different rom-com tropes but, to its credit, we are constantly kept guessing as to who, if anyone, Agathe will end up with. Much like the character she plays, who has English and French parentage, Rutherford imbues Agathe with an endearing charm as she skulks around the pastoral landscape — incapable of writing as freely as her colleagues do, experiencing nature as a menace rather than a salve. Agathe morphs into the main character of her story, but she's far from an effortlessly cool one. Emotionally dysregulated, awkward, clumsy and abrupt, Agathe has a halting yet elegant way of expressing her thoughts — prone to observing rather than experiencing. She feels like an amalgam of messy rom-com leads of yesteryear — Meg Ryan, Renee Zellweger, Drew Barrymore. Reminiscent of Mr Darcy, Anson is Hugh Grant-lite in his depiction of the prickly and reserved Oliver, while Pauly is roguish as the caddish yet well-meaning Felix. Jane Austen Wrecked My Life is at its strongest when it leans into the idiosyncrasies of its colourful cast of characters. Less successful are the overblown metaphors about writing and the confected arguments about the value of literature, though they may well be a mirror to what takes place in residencies. Most accurate would be its portrayal of writing, or perhaps how little writing happens. Agathe's journey of discovery hinges on her creative reclamation of self as much as her ability to dive headfirst into love.

AC/DC announce first Australian shows in a decade,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-23/acdc-australian-tour-2025-power-up-amyl-sniffers-dates-tickets/105448332,2025-06-23,"There'd been rumblings, and now the thunder's struck. AC/DC, one of our nation's biggest music exports, are returning home for their first Australian shows since 2015. Fronted by iconic guitarist Angus Young and vocalist Brian Johnson, the Australian rock legends will play stadiums in Melbourne (November 12), Sydney (November 21), Adelaide (November 30), Perth (December 4) and Brisbane (December 14). The Power Up tour kicked off in Europe last year, where it shifted more than 2 million tickets in 24 hours. It has continued through the US from April, and this month the band will play additional European shows before returning to Australia in November. The box office demand for these shows will be intense. AC/DC's past two homecoming tours tallied about 1 million ticket sales, but hopefully with the large gaps between dates, there will be additional shows announced to supply blockbuster demand. Late 2025 is shaping up to be busy (and costly) for rock fans, withreunited Britpop icons OasisandMetallicaalso bringing huge shows to the country from October. The tour shares its name with the band's17th studio album, Power Up, which topped the charts upon its release in 2020, making AC/DC the first band to have an Australian number one record in five consecutive decades. Supporting AC/DC at all dates will be Melbourne/Naarm pub-punks Amyl & The Sniffers. The ARIA award-winning group's international profile hasexploded in recent years— including a buzzed-about performance atCoachella festivaland a slot onUS late night TV— thanks to a fun, ferocious live show centred around charismatic ringleader Amy Taylor. Back In Black, Highway To Hell, Let There Be Rock, TNT, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap: you can expect to hear plenty of hits from many classic albums at AC/DC's forthcoming dates. The band — Johnson, Young, his nephew Stevie Young on guitar, drummer Matt Laug, and bass player Chris Chaney — have been performing a career-spanning set list on the road. These dates will be the group's first on home turf since the deaths in 2017 ofMalcolm Young, rhythm guitarist, andGeorge Young, influential producer of AC/DC's first five records, and since the childhood home of AC/DC's founding members was mistakenly demolished."
WA author pens 'gay bogan love story' that's also about male loneliness,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-23/author-holden-sheppard-king-of-dirt-novel/105440856,2025-06-23,"When he was writing young adult novels, West Australian author Holden Sheppard hid himself in his fiction, splitting his personality and past across different characters. It was an act of self-protection, he tells ABC Arts. ""It was like the sniper couldn't get me because he couldn't work out which one was me."" But Sheppard isn't hiding any more. His new book, King of Dirt, his third — and first for adults — features a narrator that's unapologetically based on himself. Like Sheppard, King of Dirt's protagonist Jack Brollo is an Italian-Australian gay man who grew up in the town of Geraldton. Both have worked construction jobs, love the Collingwood Magpies and a bourbon, and drive a hotted-up Holden SS ute they call 'Phantom'. Yet the author says Jack — who we first meet as a self-destructive loner prone to fighting and binge-drinking — is a ""sliding doors version"" of himself, a vision of how he could have turned out without the ""love and support"" of his family. ""If I hadn't come to terms with my sexuality when I was about 20, had stayed in the closet, kept working in Geraldton as a labourer with my dad, and had stayed with women instead of hooking up with guys, then Jack is probably where I would have ended up in my mid-30s,"" Sheppard explains. ""But he's a bit tougher than me,"" he laughs. ""I think he might beat me in a fight if it came to it. I'm pretty tough, but he's a bit more of a brawler."" In King of Dirt, Jack is estranged from his family, who rejected him when he was outed as gay in his late teens. Vowing to keep ""hundreds of kilometres between me and Gerro"", he spends years working in short-term remote construction jobs. Then, one day, Rocco — Jack's second cousin and his former best mate — sends him a wedding invitation, bringing him back to his home town. There, he confronts the ghosts of his past, including Brick, an old basketball teammate who he was once madly in love with. Brick is now working as a personal trainer and brings Jack into his world, helping to build his confidence and improve his mental health at the gym. Sheppard says he is irked by how gym culture is often depicted negatively. ""The gym is something I found in my 20s, and I loved it so much. ""A lot of people's perception of the gym is rooted in high school locker rooms and how much the jocks were bullies. But gyms are not like that; they're actually super positive. If you're lifting for the first time, you will find nothing but encouragement."" Sheppard describes The King of Dirt as ""a gay bogan love story"" but he was initially reluctant to embrace the bogan tag. ""The funny thing is I never thought of myself as a bogan when I was in Geraldton at all. I just thought I was a normal Aussie person."" While studying literature at university, he was amazed to hear his lecturer describe Kath and Kim as a satire of bogan life. ""I just thought it was a funny show. I know all these people; that's the culture that I've grown up around,"" he says. At university, he initially felt isolated from his artier classmates and wanted to quit. After a summer spent driving an earthmover for his father, he decided to return to university but vowed not to change for anyone. ""It was just embracing what I actually like, as opposed to what I thought I had to become to be a writer,"" he says. ""I wanted to be a writer but I also wanted to be myself."" Sheppard even featured as a bogan on ABC TV's You Can't Ask That. ""Embracing the bogan title has been actually really fun,"" he says. Sheppard says the transition from writing young adult fiction to adult literature has been freeing, allowing him to fully explore Jack's journey from repression to embracing his sexuality with frank sex scenes. ""There's so much gatekeeping in the young adult space, and frankly, I f***ing hated it,"" he says. ""It frustrated me a lot to have people [asking]: 'Is this appropriate?' You just want to scream. It's totally fine when it's a boy and a girl but, because it was two boys, it was not appropriate. ""Hearing that kind of language around your own teenage trauma is incredibly infuriating."" Sheppard says he didn't want to tone down the sex for straight readers. It's a decision that's been vindicated by the positive feedback he's already received from straight men on King of Dirt. He says some straight male readers have told him they think it's a shame many of their peers won't read it ""because it's a gay book"". These readers have enjoyed the coming-of-age element of the tale, particularly Jack's struggles with mental ill health, anger and suicide ideation. ""They could relate to being isolated, or being alienated from people you love. It's about family estrangement and male loneliness, which a lot of us go through, especially once we hit our 30s, whether you're gay, straight or bi,"" Sheppard says. ""There's a lot in there that straight men can relate to because it's really just about a bloke facing his demons and his past."" King of Dirt is published by Hardie Grant."
28 Days Later kickstarted the zombie revival. It's back for another bite,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-22/28-years-later-28-days-later-cheat-sheet/105432030,2025-06-22,"Welcome to Cheat Sheet, where we give you all the intel you need about iconic shows and films. In honour of its new addition, this time we're looking at the film franchise that revived the zombie genre, 28 Days Later. Have you ever heard of a movie trailer so popular that it forced a studio to re-release a 23-year-old film? That's what happened at the end of 2024, when fans got a first glimpse of the third film in Alex Garland's revolutionary 28 Days Later zombie series. Chillingly set to Rudyard Kipling's poem Boots — itself about the horrors of war — the teaser for 28 Years Later quickly broke the record formost-viewed trailer of 2024. Soon after, it became the second-most-viewed trailer of all time (just behind 2019's It: Chapter Two). The demand from fans was so thunderous that, two days later, Sony announced they were re-releasing the original film — which hadn't been available digitally for years due to rights issues. But 28 Years Later wasn't done gathering steam just yet. After a single day on sale, the filmbroke the recordfor most advanced tickets sold in the US for a horror film this year. Here's what you need to know. The concept of the animated undead has been lurking in cinema for almost 100 years, and has been terrorising folklore for centuries more. George A. Romero's influential 1968 flick, Night Of The Living Dead, gave silver screen zombies the reputation of being slow-moving and dim-witted — threatening because of their numbers or lack of personal protection. But the zombies in 28 Days Later presented a curious alternative. Inspired by the relentless ghouls in Japanese video game series Resident Evil, writer Alex Garland envisioned a different kind of zombie: agile, angry and lightning fast. But Garland still yearned to rid zombies of their ""magic"". Enter Trainspotting director Danny Boyle, who infused Garland's script with the concept of rage. Instead of being supernaturally reanimated corpses, the zombies in 28 Days Later are actually infected with a ""rage virus"" unwittingly released onto the British population after a test monkey escapes his lab. With a refreshing concept and a minuscule $US8 million budget under their belts, the team gathered a cast of then-unknowns and began filming in mid-2001. Beyond briefly explaining how the virus was unleashed, 28 Days Later has little interest in the lore of the infected, instead capturing the human reaction of societal collapse. Bike courier Jim (Cillian Murphy, 20 years before his Oscar win) wakes up from a coma 28 days after the initial outbreak to an empty hospital. After wandering around London, Jim eventually stumbles upon a handful of fellow survivors. They then must battle not just hoards of infected, but also the ruthless leaders who have survived by brute force. The production was consistently hounded with monetary issues. Christopher Eccleston, one of the only actors on the cast with a name, agreed to take an emergency pay cut for his work. Until one day it all caught up. ""I just had to say one day, 'We haven't got any more money,' and we packed up and left. We didn't finish the film,""producer Andrew Macdonald said. They soon returned to cobble together some sort of an ending; after showing the studio their efforts, they ponied up for one last reshoot. Released in the UK at the end of 2002, 28 Days Later became an unexpected hit, quickly breaking even and then eclipsing its budget with ticket sales. The film then became a sleeper hit in the US market, pulling down $US45 million despite an initial limited release. By the end of its original theatrical run, the movie had made back its small budget ninefold, grossing $US72 million worldwide. It was praised by critics for the political analogy hiding behind the blood and gore. Filmed while the 9/11 terrorist attacks occurred and released just a year after, Boyle says the film grasped onto a larger uneasiness in a seemingly less safe world. ""The film was the first one out of the blocks that touched — not directly, but aesthetically and morally — some of the residue of what 9/11 had done to us,"" he said in 2018. ""And, in our particular case, it made cities, which feel so immense, suddenly, they were utterly vulnerable."" Manycommentatorspointto the critical and commercial success of 28 Days Later as one of the catalysts for the zombie revival of the 2000s and early 2010s. The boom saw the release of other familiar undead fare: 2004's Dawn of the Dead remake; Spanish-language Rec (2007) (as well as its 2008 US remake, Quarantine); and World War Z (2013). But, just like a mutated virus coursing through a corpse's veins, the boom also opened the door for zombie sub-genres. There were zombie comedies like Shaun of the Dead (2004), Zombieland (2009) and Black Sheep (2006). Films like Warm Bodies (2013) even gave the zombie rom-com a crack. The zombie craze leaked into TV as well: 2011's The Walking Dead features protagonist Rick Grimes waking up in a deserted hospital. Reverberations of Boyle and Garland's fast and infected creatures can even be felt in 2023's The Last of Us, which features an unknown fungal infection that transforms the world's population into surprisingly fast monsters. In the midst of it all, Boyle and Garland (now acting as producers) had another bite at the apple with 28 Weeks Later in 2007. Following a different family caught up in the devastation, the film tracks the slow attempt at rebuilding and sinks deeper into the political ramifications of an apocalypse. Then, in 2020, 28 Days Later had a cultural resurgence no-one saw coming. One of the earliest tableaus in the original film sees Jim, disoriented and clad in hospital scrubs, stumbling around the eerily empty streets of London. It was an arresting image at the time but as cities around the world emptied due to COVID-19 lockdowns,many recognisedthesimilarity between what Boyle captured and their current reality. Speaking to theBBC, Boyle said the world's collective experience with COVID made 28 Years Later ""feel possible"". Set nearly three decades after the original, 28 Years Later shows a UK that has been quarantined by the rest of the world. The action shifts from cities to a small surviving community who have barricaded themselves in their island home, following strict, traditional rules to keep the peace. ""In the last 15 years, the world has become regressive and it's very preoccupied with looking backwards. It's all about making things great again,"" writer Alex Garland toldThe Screen Show's Jason Di Rosso. ""So [this film] is something to do with a misremembered past and what things survive, what notions survive, what things are lost."" Like its predecessors, 28 Years Later uses the still-ravaging hordes of infected as catalysts for emotional pathos, as 12-year-old villager Spike (Alfie Williams) is taken to the British mainland for the first time by his blood-thirsty father Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Boyle's affection for unusual camera rigs has also returned. Parts of 28 Days Later were filmed using a small digital video camcorder, which gave the film an almost home-movie look. This time around, Boyle turned to iPhones, binding eight, 12 and 20 phones together. ""We used [the rigs] for the violence … you could whip inside the action almost like in a 3D way, or pause it, or go back on it, startle with it. That's what we were trying to do, put beauty and horror together, which is a great combination for this kind of movie,"" Boyle told The Screen Show. ""It also gave us a chance to keep a light footprint in the countryside — we wanted it to look undisturbed."" Although not acknowledged in the title, 28 Years Later is actually the first part in Jamie and Spike's story. A sequel, 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple — which will see a heavier focus on mysterious cult leader Jimmy Crystal (Jack O'Connell) — will be released in January 2026. A third, untitled,reportedly finalfilm is currently in the works. 28 Years Later is in cinemas now."
"Despite Israel-Iran ceasefire, some analysts say we're moving into a 'danger zone'",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/iran-running-to-nuclear-bomb-after-ceasefire-analysts-say/105461634,2025-06-26,"Despite the declaration of a ceasefire between Israel, the United States and Iran, we're now ""moving into a true danger zone"". That's what Robert Pape, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, is predicting anyway. Twelve days of deadly air strikes and missile launches may have ended for now, but Professor Pape, an expert in global security affairs, has a warning. Iran is likely to speed up its nuclear program — which the US and Israel say has been the primary target of their massive strikes this month — in the wake of the attacks. He told CBS the country's conservative regime would ""probably"" now ""sprint to that nuclear weapon"". US President Donald Trump claims his country's bombing campaign has ""obliterated"" three of Iran's nuclear sites. However, even senior White House figures — including his deputy, JD Vance — admit the Iran may still have enough uranium to make 10 atomic weapons. Iran has already said it plans to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), aimed to limit the spread of nuclear weapons globally, and stop co-operating with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which had previously inspected its facilities. Professor Pape is worried Iran's program will speed up in the shadows, saying: ""We're not going to be able to see it coming."" ""That is the real danger zone we're moving in to. ""People are focusing on the things they can see, and then maybe counteract. ""What the problem is, is what we can't see, and what we won't see, because Iran is not going to tell us exactly how they're fashioning that remaining nuclear material, and whether they have some other nuclear sites we don't even know about."" Retired Israel Defense Forces (IDF) General Yaakov Amidror spent more than three decades in Israel's military and has previously advised the country's prime minister on national security. He says his division uncovered intelligence in the 90s that Iran had a nuclear weapons program and told the ABC the Gulf state had more recently been ""running to the bomb"". ""How did we know? Because they have enriched uranium for years, and they had, at the beginning of the war, more than 400 kilograms of enriched uranium up to 60 per cent. ""They needed a few weeks to enrich it to military grade."" Assessing the impact 12 days of fighting has had on Iran's nuclear program is difficult. The most high-profile targets Israel and the US attacked were facilities at Natanz, Isfahan and Fordow. While Mr Trump has been bullish about the damage done, a leaked preliminary report this week says otherwise. Before this attack, US intelligence had reportedly predicted Iran could have been as little as three months off developing a nuclear bomb. The classified report leaked to The New York Times and other outlets this week claimed it had been ""delayed but by less than six months"". On Wednesday, local time, multiple Iranian state media outlets reported the country had already begun repairing the Natanz nuclear facility. Jason Brodsky is the policy director at United Against a Nuclear Iran (UANI), a US-based not-for-profit which bills itself as ""formed to combat the threats posed by the Islamic Republic"". He's studied the region extensively, and believes these latest attacks could have set Iran's nuclear program back ""years"". He described Mr Trump's decision to order the US bombings at the weekend as a ""gutsy move"". ""It will change Iran in many ways as well,"" Mr Brodsky told the ABC. ""I was always concerned about eroded American deterrence vis-a-vis Tehran. ""I think they took advantage of America's self-deterrence after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and other deeply divisive wars that took place during that time. ""The Islamic Republic thought it could get away with murder — with everything. ""The United States sent a very loud message that we are not going to be deterring ourselves any more with respect to your nuclear program and your proxy activities,"" he said. There are conflicting accounts swirling elsewhere, too. In an interview with the Associated Press, Israel's ambassador to France, Johsua Zarka, said at least 14 Iranian nuclear scientists had been killed in the 12 days of fighting. ""The fact that the whole group disappeared is basically throwing back the program by a number of years, by quite a number of years,"" he said. Alain Bauer, a leading criminologist and national security expert, told French broadcaster BFM TV Iran's most prominent 20 nuclear scientists had been moved to Russia before the attacks. James Acton, a co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is sceptical about how much the country's mission to build an atomic weapon has been set back. ""The problem the United States and Israel have is that Iran almost certainly has materials and equipment, in locations we don't know about,"" he told the American Broadcasting Company. He said it was unlikely Iran's highly enriched uranium, which was previously stored at Isfahan, was destroyed in the attacks. ""This is material that is stored in things that look very much like scuba tanks. It's that small. Tracking that material is going to be exceptionally difficult,"" he said. Iran has claimed about 400kg of it was moved before the US dropped its bombs. ""I tend to believe them,"" Mr Acton said."
Tradies with 'destroyed' bodies want pension before 67,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/australian-pension-age-lowered-for-manual-labourers/105449298,2025-06-26,"Ross began work as a builder at 15. Now at nearly 67, he describes his body as ""destroyed"". He has been unable to work for the past four years and has been surviving on Centrelink payments and savings. Australia raised the pension age from 65 to 67 in 2023. Ross — who does not want to give his last name — believes it should be lowered on a case-by-case basis for people who have spent their lives as manual labourers. Ross would love to be spending his retirement travelling, trout fishing or pursuing some of his other interests, such as panning for gold or metal detecting. But his body and bank balance are simply not up to it. ""My medical file is 50 millimetres thick,"" he said. Do you know more? Contact Fiona Blackwood atblackwood.fiona@abc.net.au. As life expectancy has increased, so has the age at which governments will fund a pension. Denmark recently passed laws to lift the pension age from 67 to 70 by 2040, the highest in Europe. It led to protests from trade unions and concerns that manual labourers would be physically unable to work. There were demonstrations and riotswhen France lifted its pension agefrom 62 to 64 in 2023. There has also been a backlash in the UK over a move to raise the pension age to 67 for people born after 1960 and 68 for those born after 1977. It led to calls from some politicians for the state pension age to be reduced for those who work in physically demanding jobs. China is considering a plan togradually raise its pension age to 65 years for all citizens. Since the 1950s, the retirement age has been set at 60 for men, 55 for women in white-collar jobs and 50 for blue-collar female workers. Ross said living on Centrelink payments had been a struggle. He said he narrowly missed out on qualifying for a disability pension and had to wait three years for a knee replacement and is awaiting spinal surgery. ""It's pretty tough … I own my own home, that's the only reason I can survive."" Ross said during his working life, tradies were paid much less than now and he had little in the way of superannuation, which was introduced in Australia in the early 1990s. Council on the Ageing Australia chief executive, Patricia Sparrow, said rather than dropping the pension age for manual labourers, the federal government should consider lifting JobSeeker payments for everyone. ""We would support those moves to give people better financial support,"" she said. She said with one in three recruiters not considering anyone over the age of 50, older Australians should be able to access a government-funded career transition program before they begin on JobSeeker payments. The basic rate for a single person on the age pension in Australia is about $29,800 per year. A single person on a JobSeeker payment receives about $20,300 a year. In recognition that it was harder for an older person to find employment, those over 55 who have spent nine months on JobSeeker receive an extra $55 a fortnight. Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed that it took an average of 20 months for a mature-age worker to find a new job, compared with nine months for 15 to 54-year-olds. National Seniors Australia chief executive, Chris Grice, said while life expectancy had increased, it was not just manual labourers struggling to make it to pension age. ""There are other health concerns … long COVID, situations where someone has a heart attack, car accidents,"" he said. Mr Grice said JobSeeker, the age pension and the disability pension should all be increased to reflect current cost-of-living pressures, particularly for those who rent. A spokesperson from the Department of Social Services said the age pension age was not adjusted for factors affecting a person's longevity, ""such as employment type, occupational history or other social determinants of health"". The spokesperson said that rent assistance payments had increased by 45 per cent in the past three years, and the rate of JobSeeker payments had increased by more than 21 per cent. The government has no plans to change the age pension age."
'Wasn't part of the syllabus': Australia's 30-year failure in teaching writing,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/teaching-resources-reverse-students-poor-writing-naplan/105454122,2025-06-26,"NAPLAN analysis shows the writing skills of Australian children are at an all-time low after what has been described as a ""30-year policy failure"" in schools. To help reverse the decline, new resources are being launched that will enable writing to be taught across subjects like science, maths and physical education as well as English. The Australian Education Research Organisation (AERO) said the resources were designed in response to analysis of 10 years of NAPLAN data that showed many year 9 students were writing at primary-school level. ""What we discovered was that there was a large number of students whose punctuation and sentence structure was what we would expect of students at a year 4 level, so [it was] serious cause for concern because writing was such an important skill,"" AERO CEO Jenny Donovan said. AERO is government owned and was established by education ministers four years ago to come up with evidence-based solutions to declining performances in Australian schools. AERO spent the last year trialling its new resources in 10 schools across three different states, where it trained more than 35 teachers and school leaders. Teachers then taught writing across the entire school not just in English, but also in science, maths and physical education, which yielded a marked improvement in results. ""Absolutely, it's based on the evidence about how students learn. It takes an approach that makes sure that the knowledge we want students to attain is built up over time and they get opportunities to practice it,"" Ms Donovan said. Rebecca Birch is the year 7 English teacher and academic in residence at Queenwood, an independent Sydney girls' school that participated in the trial. ""Writing has been, as far as I'm concerned, a bit of an orphan capability in skills for a number of years, partly because in the English syllabus writing wasn't actually included until the last syllabus change a couple of years ago. ""So, it's a bit of a 30-year failed policy to expect that a whole school can become capable in the teaching of writing without any training."" As part of the AERO trial, Ms Birch worked with English, maths, science and PE teachers to arm them with the skills to teach and improve students' writing in these classes too. Ms Birch said there was a significant increase in the number of students in the highest-performing bands in NAPLAN for writing. More surprisingly, students also improved in other subject areas, which Ms Birch said was backed by evidence about the way students learned. ""Writing is really good for memory as well, so every piece of content, once it's written, it aids students' memory in actually remembering that material and applying it conceptually as well. It has this kind of knock-on effect,"" she said. Education academics have been keenly debating the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on skills like writing, but three experts told ABC News writing needed to remain a crucial part of school. ""In an age where AI can compose essays in seconds and we see AI writing news articles, we are asking the questions, 'Do students still need to learn how to write?' But the answer is unequivocally 'yes',"" Rebecca Marone, from the University of South Australia, said. ""These skills are foundational in every subject, every job and pretty much every conversation that we have, so these are also the skills we can't afford to lose to automation."" Dr Marone said it was still important to teach students about AI, including ethical practice on when it should and should not be used. Maria Nicholas from Deakin University said higher education institutions around the world were combating AI-fuelled cheating by reverting to paper and pen exams. Legibility and sentence structure would be important for university study, but Dr Nicholas said research increasingly showed writing was also vital for developing children's fine motor skills. ""The little precise movements that you make with fingers and wrists with your hands that are also important in everyday needs like doing up buttons or doing up shoelaces,"" Dr Nicholas said. Alex Bacalja from the University of Melbourne said writing would remain foundational, but young people should still be equipped to be critical users of AI. ""While resources that support the teaching of writing across the curriculum are welcome, we need to take seriously the lag between new technologies and their impact on teaching method,"" Dr Bacalja said. ""Educators should resist the temptation to defer the teaching of writing to generative AI. We risk developing a generation who are very good at developing prompts but struggle to understand how language works."""
'The Murdochs really hate Trump': Carlson says Fox CEO urged election run,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/tucker-carlson-lachlan-murdoch-donald-trump/105452318,2025-06-26,"Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson says the network's boss, Lachlan Murdoch, encouraged him to run for US president to thwart Donald Trump's return to the White House. ""The Murdochs really hate Trump,"" Carlson said. ""There's no-one who hates Trump more than the Murdochs."" Carlson was one of Fox News's biggest and highest-paid stars before he was dumped by the conservative network in April 2023. The following month, he said, Mr Murdoch offered to throw the family's considerable weight behind a potential run in the 2024 presidential election. Carlson made the claim while speaking to his former Fox colleague Clayton Morris on his podcast his week. Carlson: ""Lachlan Murdoch said: 'You should run for president. We'll back you, the whole thing.'"" Morris: ""The whole Fox News apparatus?"" Carlson: ""And not just Fox, but, you know, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Post, The Times of London …"" Morris: ""All of their papers?"" Carlson: ""Yeah absolutely, 'We'll back you'. I was already gone — they'd already cancelled my show. I was still under contract, but they had cancelled my show."" Carlson said he knocked back the Australian media executive's idea in part because he liked Mr Trump. ""I get frustrated, I'm frustrated now. But I like Trump,"" he said. Carlson was sacked afterFox News agreed to pay a $US787 million ($1.2 billion) settlement to Dominion Voting Systemsafter the company sued the network over its coverage of conspiracy theories about voting machines used in the 2020 election, which Mr Trump lost to Joe Biden. Mr Murdoch is the executive chair and CEO of Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News, and chair of News Corp. His family's ownership of Fox News and other major outlets has afforded them considerable political influence for decades in the US, as well as Australia and the UK. Family patriarch Rupert Murdoch, the father of Lachlan Murdoch, has had a long and storied relationship with the current president. It appears to be once again cordial, with Rupert Murdoch even enjoying a personal visit to the Oval Office earlier this year. Mr Trump praised the nonagenarian as an ""amazing guy"" and in a ""class by himself"". But the two billionaires have come into conflict repeatedly, particularly with respect to coverage of Mr Trump's political campaigning. Mr Trump was furious with Fox News for calling Arizona for Mr Biden relatively early on election night in 2020. The call undermined Mr Trump's incorrect claim the election was stolen from him. In the aftermath, Mr Trump started to promote Fox alternatives including Newsmax and OANN. He also argued, in the lead-up to the 2024 Republican primary, that many Murdoch outlets provided unfairly large amounts of coverage to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who was seen as Mr Trump's major rival for the nomination. Mr Trump took to social media to accuse the Murdochs of backing Mr DeSantis's campaign. Carlson also said Fox was annoyed when he would have Mr Trump on his Fox program. But since his return to the presidency, Mr Trump has been once again embraced by Fox — one of the few major mainstream US outlets not regularly labelled as ""fake news"" by the president. Since leaving Fox, Carlson has branched off into his own media ventures, including a podcast and YouTube channel, where he has become increasingly critical of his former employer. In the past few weeks, he has also become one of the faces of a rift in the MAGA movement over US military involvement in Iran. Before Mr Trump ordered the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, Carlson was pointedly critical of any US attack, arguing it was against the US national interest and was primarily being pushed by pro-Israel voices. He accused Fox of broadcasting ""pro-Israel propaganda"". Carlson also took to social media to directly call out Rupert Murdoch for his role, writing: ""Who are the warmongers? They would include anyone who's calling Donald Trump today to demand air strikes and other direct US military involvement in a war with Iran."" He named Fox presenters Sean Hannity and Mark Levin, businessman Ike Perlmutter and conservative political donor Miriam Adelson, as well as Rupert Murdoch, and wrote: ""At some point, they will all have to answer for this, but you should know their names now."" He also accused the president of being ""complicit in the act of war"" for allowing Israel to strike Iran. When asked about Carlson's criticisms last week, Mr Trump mocked his relevance. ""I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying,"" Mr Trump said. ""Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen."" Polling suggests that a majority of Republicans back the US president's decision to strike Iran, despite the criticisms from Carlson and others. Lachlan Murdoch, Fox Corporation and the White House have been contacted for comment."
Medical graduates question rural relocation work scheme,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/vic-bonded-medical-program-review-rural-doctors/105450570,2025-06-26,"The peak body for medical students says a government program mandating newly graduated doctors work in regional areas is flawed and in urgent need of review. The Bonded Medical Program (BMP) offers Commonwealth-supported places in medical courses at Australian universities. In return, participants must complete three years of service in eligible regional, rural or remote areas within 18 years of graduating, in a bid to ease staff shortages in locations that may otherwise struggle to attract doctors. However, only 13 per cent of the nearly 17,000 participants have completed their return of service (ROS) obligation since the program began in 2001, despite the federal government investing more than $170 million over its first 20 years. The Australian Medical Students' Association (AMSA) said changing life circumstances were prompting many participants to rescind their commitment, which required them to pay out the cost of their course. ""We've had consultants come to us and express how challenging it is to fulfil their ROS obligation and are asking us to advocate on their behalf,"" advocacy officer Sparsh Tiwari said. ""We've had a couple of situations where the stress of the ROS obligations has been quite severe."" Griffith University medical student Taylor Cabassi may soon face that dilemma. After years of hard work, the Townsville local accepted a bonded place at a Sunshine Coast campus. But two years later, she said personal changes had made it difficult for her to relocate, leaving her unsure whether she would be able to fulfil the obligation. She also plans to specialise in forensic pathology, which has limited training and job opportunities outside of major cities. ""I'd only be able to work in Brisbane, Gold Coast or Townsville,"" Ms Cabassi said. Ms Cabassi is one of many students concerned about completing the obligation too early in their careers. ""It was one of those things where I thought, 'Oh, I'll just figure it out,' but then that's also a lot of time for things to change,"" she said. The concerns come as many regional, rural and remote areas struggle to recruit and retain doctors. Competition is so severe that some towns have resorted to so-called""bidding wars"", offering huge salary packages and, in some cases, free housing to attract doctors from cities. The shortages are having consequences for health provision, with people living in the most under-served areas receiving about a third fewer specialist services than their peers in areas with better coverage, according to a report by the Grattan institute. Rural Doctors Association of Australia CEO Peta Rutherford agreed the bonded program had potential but said it needed to better support students who commit before making serious career decisions. ""When you're looking at your return of service obligations, they're happening later in your training pathway or later in your career,"" Ms Rutherford said. ""That becomes really difficult when you've settled, you've got a partner who works, or you've got kids in school."" The scheme has had multiple revisions — including more time to complete the obligation and flexible work options — but the AMSA hopes to conduct research that will guide further evidence-based reform. Mr Tiwari questioned whether the program, as it stood, fostered long-term rural staff retention. ""Yes, you can push people for three years into a rural site but, at the end of the day, to what extent does that solve the workforce shortages?"" Mr Tiwari asked. ""We know that based on previous studies and audits there's been a low expression of interest in actually remaining and sustaining rural ties."" Federal Health Minister Mark Butler said rebuilding general practice was a top priority, with new incentives and payments introduced to support rural doctors. ""We're seeing a rush of new doctors joining the health system, with more doctors joining in the last two years than at any time in the past decade,"" he said. Ms Rutherford said one cause of the recent decline in doctors choosing to work rurally was government changes to classifications that ranked the remoteness of locations and their need for doctors. However, the changes mean bonded graduates and internationally trained doctors or medical graduates can fulfil their obligation to work in areas of need that are much closer to metropolitan centres. ""We acknowledge that outer-metropolitan areas have workplace pressures; they need GPs, particularly in bulk-billing services,"" Ms Rutherford said. ""That's OK, but only if the policies are being ramped up to incentivise people going to rural and remote locations. ""Because, when all things are equal, it's really easy to stay in the city as a doctor."""
Khawaja refuses radio interview after SEN axed journalist over Gaza posts,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/usman-khawaja-refuses-to-speak-to-sen-peter-lalor/105462370,2025-06-26,"Usman Khawaja has refused to speak to radio broadcaster SEN after day one of the first Test against the West Indies in Bridgetown. It has been reported the Australia opener's decision was in response to SEN standing down cricket journalist Peter Lalor earlier this year over pro-Palestinian social media posts. Lalor, covering the West Indies series for his Cricket Et Al podcast, said he was grateful for Khawaja's support. ""Usman is a man of principle whose support I valued greatly when I was dismissed and whose ongoing support I appreciate,"" he said in a statement. Cricket Australia has been contacted for comment. Khawaja was a vocal supporter of Lalorafter he was let go by SEN during Australia's Test tour of Sri Lanka. ""Standing up for the people of Gaza is not antisemitic nor does it have anything to do with my Jewish brothers and sisters in Australia, but everything to do with the Israeli government and their deplorable actions,"" Khawaja wrote on Instagram. ""It has everything to do with justice and human rights. Unfortunately hatred towards the Jewish and Muslim community will always exist. ""Pete is a good guy with a good heart. He deserves better."" Khawaja has made several statements on social media and tried to do the same on the field in the past. The 38-year-old wasbanned by the ICC from displaying the message ""All lives are equal"" and ""Freedom is a human right""on his shoes during a 2023 Test against Pakistan. Heopted to wear a black armbandand tape over the messages on his playing kit."
Where is Wylie Oscar? Behind the search for the missing stockman,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/the-search-for-missing-man-wylie-oscar/105337330,2025-06-26,
Domino's pizzas allegedly cooked using woodchips from endangered possum habitat,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/sawmill-investiged-illegal-logging-state-forest-possum-habitat/105458952,2025-06-26,"When Domino's advertised its ""smokehouse"" pizzas in 2023, it trumpeted that the meat was smoked over timber logged from ""Aussie Mountain ash"". It also advertised that the timber was certified as sustainable. But what the advertising didn't promote was that mountain ash forests are critically endangered, with logging listed as one of the key processes threatening them. And now the ABC can reveal the certification that assured consumers that logging was sustainable was breached in seven different ways, according to the organisation that accredits certifiers. Those breaches included potentially stealing the trees from the neighbouring state forest, ignoring protections for waterways and logging potential endangered species habitat. ""Logging operations are being certified that should not be,"" said Professor David Lindenmayer of ANU, one of the world's leading forest ecologists. ""Again, we've seen a failure of regulation at a number of levels, not only within government but within other bodies that are supposed to be assuring the public that timber is being sustainably produced."" The woodchips used to smoke the pizzas came from Powelltown sawmill in Mount Horsfall, Victoria, which conducted logging on a nearby private property. The certification for the logging was awarded by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Australians rely on the FSC logo to make informed decisions about the timber products they buy, ensuring that they are sustainable and not contributing to deforestation or impacting threatened species. But in 2023 Chris Taylor, from the Australian National University, discovered the logging on the property appeared to have been conducted outside the boundaries of the private property, in the neighbouring state forest. He also found the logging had been conducted within 200 metres of a Leadbeater's possum sighting. An investigation by Assurance Services International (ASI), who accredit FSC certifiers and investigates alleged breaches to FSC standards, found that it couldn't establish the logging stayed outside of the public state forest. It also found Powelltown logged potential habitat of Leadbeater's possums, among a slew of other damning findings. Powelltown sawmills told the ABC its timber harvesting at Mount Horsfall was in full compliance with all relevant environmental regulations and forestry legislation. Dr Taylor initially raised the issue with Victoria's Office of the Conservation Regulator in November 2023, who dismissed it on the basis that they were unsure of the boundaries of the state forests they regulate. ""The conservation regulator has now closed this investigation and will not be taking any further action,"" the regulator wrote to Dr Taylor at the time. Dr Taylor said the regulator's approach was ""extraordinary"". ""What's to stop another property owner cutting across the boundary and just saying, 'Well, I don't know where the boundary is',"" Dr Taylor said. ""Why are we allowing such loose interpretations of where boundaries are supposed to occur in these forested areas?"" When Dr Taylor went to inspect the alleged breaches he was met with a locked gate within state forest, 380 metres from the documented boundary of the Mount Horsfall operation, and a sign that said ""private property"". ""It's gobsmacking that you can make such a substantial transgression into state forest, where there is threatened species habitat… and not find a transgression,"" Professor Lindenmayer said. A spokesperson for the OCR said there was ""no single source of truth on the boundary."" ""Based on the significant contradictory information and the environmental impacts that would occur if attempts were made to re-establish the boundary to a legal standard, the investigation was completed, and the allegations were not substantiated."" They said the Department of Environment, Energy and Climate Action was working with the landowner to agree on the property boundary between the state forest and private property. Dr Taylor eventually took his complaint about Powelltown Sawmill's Mount Horsfall operation to Assurance Services International (ASI), who investigated the certification accreditation body, Soil Association Certification (SAC) and their decision to award the Mount Horsfall operation with FSC certification. ASI identified seven breaches of FSC standards by Powelltown that had not been picked up by SAC. It found SAC ignored the boundary uncertainty, despite the risk of illegal logging, failed to prevent logging in potential endangered species habitat and failed to detect that Powelltown had prematurely added the Mount Horsfall property to its FSC certification. ASI also discovered that Powelltown logged within 40 metre buffer zones put in place to protect water streams and failed to identify known high conservation value areas, which went undetected by SAC. Dr Taylor has been involved with three different complaints to ASI about inappropriate FSC certification over the years, all of which were found in his favour. He said certification accreditation bodies such as SAC, who are paid by companies like Powelltown to conduct audits and provide certification, could have a conflict of interest when assessing their clients. In a response to questions from the ABC, a spokesperson for FSC said it ensured independence through a ""robust"" third-party system that separated standard-setting, certification and oversight. ""FSC sets the forest management standards but does not audit forest operations or issue certificates. Instead, certification bodies, such as Soil Association, are independently accredited by ASI to audit against FSC's standards. ""ASI also monitors the adequacy of their certification decisions and investigates concerns about their performance. ""This separation removes conflicts of interests in certification decisions and helps uphold the credibility of the FSC system."" SAC is now required to take formal corrective actions, the FSC spokesperson said. In a statement to the ABC, SAC said it was taking the matter seriously and is currently reviewing the issues raised by the investigation. ""We place the utmost importance on our integrity and impartiality relating to the execution of our role as a certification body."" Australians will be familiar with the FSC symbol. When Domino's initially advertised their new ""mountain ash"" smoked meat range pizzas (and then very quickly removed the words ""mountain ash"") alarm bells went off for Professor Lindenmayer. ""I think Australians should be absolutely appalled that the world's tallest flowering tree is chipped up to make woodchips to smoke pork bellies to put on pizzas. It's ridiculous. What are we talking about? Endangered possum pizzas?"" Professor Lindenmayer said. In a statement to the ABC, Domino's said they no longer source any food items directly or indirectly from Powelltown sawmills. ""At the time, we were provided with verified documentation confirming all FSC and sustainability requirements were met,"" the company said. Dr Taylor, who has previously served on the FSC board, said FSC standards were good, but needed to be followed and the audits against those standards must be done ""thoroughly and properly"". ""The standard of a certification scheme is only as good as its worst performing member. If you have operations that are being certified that are not meeting the standard, then that actually brings it down for everybody. ""There can't be a grading system. It's just the [FSC] label."" FSC said the ASI investigation showed the FSC system at work. ""When stakeholders raise concerns and complaints through formal channels…these are independently assessed and addressed through a credible and transparent process."""
Aussie sets world record with 800km run in five days,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/phil-gore-backyard-ultra-world-record-at-dead-cow-gully/105461266,2025-06-26,"Australian endurance athlete Phil Gore has broken the world record for the Backyard Ultra marathon after running almost 800 kilometres in five days on a southern Queensland cattle farm. The West Australian ran 119 laps of the 6.7-kilometre course at the Dead Cow Gully Backyard Masters event outside Nanango, 180km north-west of Brisbane. ""It's amazing,"" Gore said after crossing the line in the early hours of Thursday morning. ""The bar keeps getting raised higher and higher and I'm glad that I'm still able to keep up with it. Gore ran 797.3km to break the previous world record of 116 loops, which was held by Belgian Łukasz Wróbel. Billed as a race with no finish line, the Backyard Ultra format has no predefined length or time but requires runners to complete a 6.7km loop every hour. The competition is over when only one runner remains to complete a loop. A field of 263 runners set off at 7am on Saturday and the final two competitors were still running before daybreak early on Thursday. Sam Harvey from New Zealand was the final runner to drop out of the race at the start of the 118th loop, which set a New Zealand national record for the Backyard Ultra distance. ""I wanted to get to sun-up … and 500 miles, but gravity wasn't my friend,"" Harvey said, adding that his Achilles tendon ""blew up"" on Tuesday night. During the event two female national records were broken. Australia's Holly Ranson ran 61 loops (408km) and New Zealand's Jane McAlpine ran 53 loops (355km). Race director and fourth-generation cattle farmer Tim Walsh said the event, which attracted runners from Japan, Belgium, Spain and the United States, was now a fixture on the international running calendar. After running for five days straight, Gore joked that his next race will be shorter. ""I might do a 24-hour instead,"" he laughed."
"Mundella workers, suppliers owed thousands as administrators take over",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/wa-dairy-mundella-administration-workers-claim-super-missing/105443940,2025-06-26,"It took just 18 months for two well-known dairy companies in southern Western Australia to come crashing down into administration after a local family took them over from Chinese ownership. When lead proprietor Hayden Russell took over Mundella Foods and Margaret River Dairy Co it was hailed as a coup for the parochial WA dairy industry. However, some of the employees are now claiming they are missing thousands of dollars in superannuation. Mr Russell reportedly said the financial issues arose due to ""short milk supply"". Suppliers and employees have told the ABC there was deeper dysfunction at play. Former and current staff describe a ""toxic"" workplace, ""cutting corners"", and delays or failure to pay some bills and staff superannuation. The environmental regulator is also investigating Mundella Foods amid reports of alleged dumping of wastewater containing commercial cleaning chemicals at Mundella's yoghurt factory. The ABC has repeatedly attempted to contact Mr Russell for comment and was told via text that it was ""business as usual"". Mr Russell's ambitions in WA's micro-dairy sector began in 2022 when he purchased The Cheeky Cow Dairy, branding the company as ""wanting dairy done differently, dairy done better"". In late 2023, the Busselton dairy farmer expanded by purchasing yoghurt producer, Mundella Foods, and Margaret River Dairy Co. from Chinese food giant, Bright Foods Group. Damien Maring worked as a pasteuriser at Mundella's yoghurt factory at Mundijong, on the outskirts of Perth, from 2022 before quitting in 2024. Mr Maring said the factory began to experience regular interruptions to production. ""I had to stop making things in the morning because they had run out of buckets, run out of tubs, run out of labels because they just hadn't been ordered,"" he said. The Department of Water and Environmental Regulations has told the ABC it is actively investigating Mundella Foods. The ABC understands the regulator's investigation was in response to reports of alleged dumping of wastewater contaminated with commercial cleaning chemicals used to disinfect pasteurising equipment. A photo provided to the ABC appears to show water, said to be the alleged wastewater, being released in a nearby paddock. Along with the ""toxic"" workplace culture, several staff have said they were still owed superannuation. Mr Maring said he was still owed about $2,500 in superannuation, which was yet to be paid by the company in the 2024-'25 financial year. Former maintenance technician Christopher Hobson claims he is also missing about $5,000 in superannuation from Mundella Foods. ""I've emailed them maybe three or four times since I left, and now I've proceeded to the ATO to follow up,"" he said. ""I don't think people go to work to not get paid super."" Mr Hobson worked at the yoghurt factory from June until his resignation in November last year. He said it was the ""worst"" workplace culture he had experienced. ""I could see something coming,"" Mr Hobson said. ""I didn't think it would actually last this long."" The Australian Taxation Office told the ABC it was unable to comment due to obligations under taxpayer confidentiality laws. Administrator of the dairy companies, Mackay Goodwin, is still keeping the business operational. The administration is yet to confirm the number of creditors or how much they are owed. ""The administrators are still receiving claims and, importantly, assessing the direction of the business,"" a Mackay Goodwin spokesperson said in a statement. ""It would be difficult to state certain figures in isolation and out of context [due to commercial sensitivities]."" Suppliers claim previous, repeated attempts to contact Mr Russell and management about outstanding bills had been met with silence. Redgate Contracting owner Mick Kelly is among those who say they are still owed money. Mr Kelly said he was still owed about $40,000 for a range of services carried out at Mr Russell's dairy farm in Busselton early last year. ""That was probably six months ago and nothing."" The deteriorating situation at Mundella Foods has saddened employees, who say they had taken pride in building a beloved dairy brand, originally established in 1974. ""I hate that,"" Mr Maring said. ""It was the best place ever."" The administrator said it was obligated to ""gather and investigate"" claims of unpaid bills and superannuation, and would report back to creditors in several weeks."
Looters swoop as landslip forces 'helpless' residents from their homes,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/unoccupied-homes-looted-after-landslip-forces-residents-to-leave/105458760,2025-06-26,"Residents forced to abandon their homes after a landslip in Newcastle last month have been left feeling ""helpless"" as looters target the unoccupied dwellings. Fifteen properties were evacuated after a landslip near Russell Road in New Lambton on May 23 following heavy rain in the region. Almost five weeks later, residents are still unable to return home, as geotechnical engineers carry out assessments. Leonie Morgan is one of 39 affected residents and believes her home was one of the first to be looted. ""We were allowed to go in and check on the property and my husband phoned me and said, 'We've been burgled, everything valuable is gone,'"" she said. Ms Morgan said the family had lost items with huge sentimental value. ""They took my grandmother's pearls I'd inherited. ""Basically, [they took] every bit of jewellery I ever had."" Ms Morgan said, after speaking with neighbours, they found out at least two other properties had also been burgled. Ms Morgan said despite her home now being boarded up with wooden panels, it appeared another break-in had been attempted. ""Our door was found partially kicked in,"" she said. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, police arrested a 28-year-old man who was allegedly found running from one of the unoccupied properties. Police say a subsequent search of the man allegedly revealed bank cards, perfume bottles, electronics, watches, and other jewellery items believed to have been stolen. He was charged with a range of offences, including breaking and entering, and granted conditional bail. David, who asked to be identified only by his first name, is another resident whose home has been ransacked in recent weeks. He told ABC Newcastle that security services, which residents were told the council had engaged to protect their homes, had failed. ""If council has deployed security, we'd like to know where and when they're operating, because we haven't seen them and they haven't reported any of the break-ins,"" David said. In a statement, the Newcastle Council said most residents had been able to access their homes at least twice to retrieve essential belongings. It said affected residents should continue to engage directly with their insurer regarding claims to private property. For the past five weeks, Ms Morgan has been living in a hotel. With four children, she said it had been less than ideal. ""I've got a 22-year-old son and he is most distressing to deal with because he's category-three autistic,"" she said. ""So this is just something he can't even comprehend … and I don't have anywhere else for him to go. We feel helpless. Ms Morgan said her most recent update from council was that the assessment by geotechnical engineers that was underway would take at least two months. In a statement, a Newcastle Council spokesperson said it was now seeking the support of the NSW Reconstruction Authority to lead the recovery response."
Tara Cheyne reveals stranger sexually assaulted her in broad daylight,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/tara-cheyne-sexual-assault-victim-speaking-out-lights-running/105461244,2025-06-26,"ACT Attorney-General Tara Cheyne has revealed she is a past victim of a sexual assault by a stranger, an incident that still traumatises her. It comes after a59-year-old woman was assaulted by a teenager in broad daylightwhile out running in Bonner, ACT, last month, andanother woman was grabbed by a man while running in March. During a debate in the Legislative Assembly about a motion on women's safety, Ms Cheyne spoke for the first time about the incident that occurred outside of Canberra while she was in her 20s. ""I haven't ever spoken about it."" Ms Cheyne said the incident was incredibly demoralising. ""That is extraordinarily unfair. It has meant I have some unresolved trauma from it because I felt too ashamed to talk to anybody at the time. ""I pushed it out of my memory. ""I don't want to make it about me, but what I'm trying to do is demonstrate [that] women are unsafe everywhere. ""It doesn't matter about the lighting, footpaths, whether you're in the home or somewhere else — all these places, women's lives are at risk."" The Legislative Assembly was debating a motion, brought by Independent MLA Thomas Emerson, calling for the ACT government to roll out new measures to support women's safety. Mr Emerson said 93 per cent of women respondents to his online poll said they did not feel safe exercising at night in Canberra. The ACT government's own Gender Sensitive Urban Design Guidelines indicate that better lighting is the most effective way to improve women's sense of safety in public spaces. ""It's really sad that we have to be having these conversations, and there's a lot that needs to happen when it comes to our boys and young men. ""At the same time, there are things we can be doing to make it easier for people to feel safe in public spaces."" Mr Emerson was criticised by members in the assembly for taking the credit for work done by others — particularly women — by bringing the bill to the assembly by himself and for failing to get to the heart of gender-based violence, despite his good intentions. For Canberran Kim Elms, running has been a key method of socialising and maintaining fitness for more than 20 years. She said she does ""not at all"" feel safe running around Canberra. Ms Elm always tells somewhere where she plans to run, has her partner track her on an app, and tries to always plan runs with friends so that she feels safer. The group she runs with uses head torches and sometimes phone flashlights to see where they are going and to feel safe. Ms Elm chooses to run where there are lights in winter, when some of her friends stop running altogether because the path around Lake Burley Griffin is too dark. While Ms Elm knows lights won't completely fix the problem, she hopes to see them installed, at least around the lake, soon, so more women feel safer. ""This year, there have been a couple of attacks that have really rammed home that we're not safe — even in daylight,"" she said."
US sanctions Mexican banks for allegedly laundering money for drug cartels,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/us-sanctions-mexican-banks-for-allegedly-laundering-money/105462344,2025-06-26,"The US Treasury has slapped three Mexican financial institutions with sanctions, accusing them of laundering millions of dollars for cartels that are furthering the distribution of fentanyl into the US. It is a move, under the Trump administration's new fentanyl sanctions authority, that officials say will block certain money transfers between the sanctioned banks and US banks. The banks, CIBanco and Intercam Banco, as well as brokerage Vector Casa de Bolsa, ""have collectively played a longstanding and vital role in laundering millions of dollars on behalf of Mexico-based cartels"" US deputy Treasury secretary Michael Faulkender told reporters on Wednesday, local time. He added the financial institutions were ""facilitating payments for the procurement of precursor chemicals needed to produce fentanyl"" and would now be  ""effectively cut off"" from doing business with US financial institutions. While the sanctions do not block property or cut off all global US dollar-based activities, as other Treasury sanctions have, they do prohibit US transactions with their locations in Mexico, a US Treasury official noted. Although US sanctions against individuals and companies for links to Mexican organised crime groups are fairly frequent, measures against financial institutions are far less common. The Mexican Finance Ministry said in a statement it was notified of the investigation and asked the US Treasury for evidence of illicit activity links to CIBanco, Intercam and Vector, but it received no ""conclusive information"". Vector categorically rejected ""any accusation that compromises its institutional integrity"", it said in a statement. It added that it reiterated its full willingness to collaborate with Mexican and US authorities to clarify the situation. Intercam similarly ""categorically"" denied ""any connection between this institution and any illicit practice"". CIBanco did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Experts said the move, although targeting relatively small institutions, could have significant impact on Mexico's financial system given the interconnectedness with the United States. Luis Manuel Perez de Acha, a tax lawyer and money laundering expert in Mexico City, said the accusations were a ""bombshell"". ""The entire financial system passes through the United States, so they are practically left without operations,"" he said. Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a specialist on organised crime, said the sanctions were ""enormously impactful"". ""This is a bold move. Being cut off from the US financial system is a death blow,"" she told Reuters. ""These are hardly the biggest banks in Mexico, but they are not small entities."" ""These are medium-level banks,"" Ms Felbab-Brown said. However, she said the sanctions were unlikely to ""make any kind of dent in the financial flows of Mexican criminal groups"". According to the Treasury orders, CIBanco helped facilitate money laundering for a number of cartels, including the Jalisco New Generation, Beltran Leyva and Gulf. Officials said the bank ""facilitated procurement"" of chemicals used to make fentanyl from China by processing over $US2.1 million in payments for the materials. Vector was accused of facilitating money laundering for the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels, including $US1 million in payments for fentanyl chemicals. The Treasury officials also said the Sinaloa Cartel used Vector to send bribes to former Mexican security secretary Genaro García Luna, who in October was sentenced to more than 38 years in prison by a New York court for the charges. They estimated that transactions exceeded $US40 million. The Trump administration has announced it is cracking down on Mexican cartels and fentanyl trafficking despite movement of the drug along the US border and overdoses within the country declining.

Australia to provide $20 million package to Solomon Islands for key forum,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/australia-to-support-solomon-islands-pacific-islands-forum/105461512,2025-06-26,"Australia will provide Solomon Islands with dozens of vehicles and cybersecurity support to help it host a high-profile meeting of Pacific leaders in September, as well as ramping up funding for aerial surveillance to track illegal fishing flotillas across the region. The Pacific Minister Pat Conroy is in Honiara on Thursday, where he will announce a $20 million support package for the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) leaders meeting. Leaders at the meeting will grapple with a host of issues, including climate finance and Australia's bid to co-host a Conference of the Parties climate meeting, a new ""Oceans of Peace"" security framework championed by Fiji's prime minister, and a potentially contentious review of the Pacific's diplomatic architecture. But the gathering will also inevitably be seen as a litmus test of China's sway in Solomon Islands, where Beijing has rapidly built political influence since establishing ties with Honiara in 2019. Earlier this month China's ambassador to Solomon Islands handed Acting Prime Minister Fredrick Kologetoa a $US1 million ($1.5 million) donation to buy 27 vehicles which will ferry Pacific leaders around at PIF. Australia's $20 million package will be broader, providing funding for about 60 vehicles, cybersecurity, road upgrades and logistics support. Australia has not directly criticised China's contribution to the meeting, but MrConroy said the Pacific was ""best served by Pacific-led institutions and processes"". ""Australia's commitment to Solomon Islands and the broader Pacific is steadfast. We are stronger together,"" Mr Conroy said. China is also expected to push for its policing teams to play a visible role providing security at the leaders meeting, something Australia will be keen to prevent, in order to burnish its credentials as a security partner for the Pacific. During an interview with the ABC on Tuesday while visiting Papua New Guinea, Mr Conroy reiterated that China was ""seeking a permanent security presence in the Pacific"". When the ABC asked him if China might try to leverage its Pacific policing links to help it establish ""dual use"" commercial infrastructure which it could exploit for military purposes down the track — something Australian officials have warned of privately — Mr Conroy said that was a ""reasonable conclusion"" to draw. The ABC has been told the pacific minister will also use his visit to Honiara to announce the government will deliver on its 2022 election promise to double funding for aerial patrols delivered under the Pacific Maritime Security Program, which he will cast as a major win for regional security. Pacific nations have become increasingly alarmed by the illegal fishing in the region, which has devastated ecosystems and livelihoods, costing them up to $500 million in lost revenue over recent years. In 2022 Labor promised that if elected it would increase funding to the program by $12 million a year from 2024-25, and federal government tender documents — firstreported on by Reuters— suggest thegovernment will pour a total of up to $477 millioninto the program over the next decade. While there is only limited public data available on illegal fishing in the Pacific, analysts have previously told the ABC that vessels from China and Taiwan are responsible for much of the devastation. While in PNG Mr Conroy took a thinly veiled swipe at Beijing on illegal fishing, labelling it a ""scourge"" and saying countries that failed to rein in it were ""literally stealing food out of the mouths of Pacific Island people"". ""And I would urge all balanced observers to reflect on the countries that allow that activity to occur and think: Do they have the interests of the Pacific islands of the heart if they allow that illegal fishing to occur?"""
At the end of its lifespan what's next for this heritage wind farm?,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/albany-grasmere-wind-farm-future-nearing-end-of-life/105455470,2025-06-26,"One of the country's first wind farms could break new ground with the owners of the Albany Grasmere Wind Farm considering the largest domestic upgrade of its heritage infrastructure. The 18-turbine wind farm, 420 kilometres south of Perth on Western Australia's south coast, was commissioned in 2001 with 12 turbines. The existing turbines — an additional six were added in 2011 — stand about 60 metres tall with a blade diameter of 70 metres. WA's state-run power provider Synergy estimates it generates about 80 per cent of Albany's electricity needs. In addition to generating power for Albany the farm is visited by an estimated 200,000 visitors each year. Once the largest commercial wind farm in Australia, its aging technology means it is a comparative minnow. ""It was a 35-megawatt facility, which was huge at the time. It was nation-leading,"" said energy analyst Tom Quinn. ""Today your biggest wind farm in WA is the Warradarge wind farm which is 283MW in size, almost 10 times as big. On average, wind farms have a 30-year shelf life. While no commercial projects have reached the milestone, Albany Grasmere is one of three across the country approaching the end of its predicted operating life. Australia's oldest commercial wind farm in Codrington, Victoria, was commissioned three months before Albany Grasmere and was marked for decommissioning with owners Pacific Blue citing high re-powering costs. The Huxley Hill wind farm, built on King Island in Tasmania in 1998, is undergoing an $11 million restoration to its existing turbines. Recent approval for a meteorological mast to measure wind data at Albany Grasmere could indicate that a wholesale expansion of the WA facility may be on the cards. Mr Quinn said Albany's power generation was about 1.5 to 1.8MW per wind tower, while modern towers can deliver 6-7MW per tower. ""I would suspect they'll swap out the entire unit,"" Mr Quinn said. ""Modern turbines give you a lot more grunt for the same turbine footprint. ""I think that's probably going to be the most likely pathway the company will take."" Owner Bright Energy Investments, which jointly runs the site with Synergy, said a plan for the future of the site was underway. General manager Tom Frood said data from the yet-to-be built meteorological mast would determine the future of the site. ""[It includes] the option to rebuild the wind turbines with newer technology increasing the generation capacity,"" he said. Mr Frood said the wind farm was an ""iconic landmark"" that would play a significant role in Western Australia's sustainable energy future. More modern turbines used innewer developmentsacross the region are double in size of those used near Albany. City of Albany executive director of infrastructure, development and environment Paul Camins said the city was supportive of redeveloping the facility. ""Albany was one of the first regional cities in Australia to embrace wind power and we are proud of the role we have played in advancing renewable energy,"" he said. ""We know our community values Albany's unique natural and coastal landscapes, so any proposal would need to be carefully assessed and considered. Mr Quinn said the Albany Grasmere site could act as a litmus test for other aging facilities around the country. ""It's one of the oldest, and it'll be really interesting to see how they go about this process,"" Mr Quinn said. ""We're going to see more of it, and I think there's an opportunity to get it right and set that template for how to do this."""
"Ex-student hacked uni for free parking before threatening data drop, police say",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/western-sydney-university-hack-former-student-charged/105462320,2025-06-26,"A former Western Sydney University student allegedly escalated from hacking into the uni's servers for free parking to threatening the sale of her peers' data on the dark web. Police said the hacks began in 2021, when the woman allegedly first accessed the school's servers to secure free parking on campus. Once inside the university's system, the former student then allegedly began changing her own grades before then downloading personal information and threatening to sell it on the dark web, police have alleged. With help from the Australian Federal Police and cyber security experts, NSW Police said they then identified that the hacker was a former student at the university. The woman, 27, was arrested on Wednesday during a search of her home in Kingswood, where police seized a mobile phone and other electronic devices. She was charged with 21 offences, including 10 counts of accessing or modifying data held in a computer. She was refused bail by police and is expected to appear in Parramatta Local Court on Thursday. In July last year the university notified staff and students that a hacker had stolen 580 terabytes of data, though whether or not yesterday's arrest is related has not been confirmed. In total, the bank details, tax file numbers and other sensitive personal details of more than 7,500 were stolen in the breach at the time."
"Farmer recovering after culling 500,000 chickens amid bird flu outbreak",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/victorian-poultry-farm-bird-flu-outbreak-recovery/105459172,2025-06-26,"A Victorian farmer who had to kill more 500,000 chickens to control an outbreak of bird flu has detailed the financial and emotional cost of the ""devastating"" ordeal. Phillip Szepe and his wife, Jane Szepe, own Kinross Farms near Euroa in the state's north, wherebird flu was detectedon four separate free-range egg farms. The outbreak began in Febuary and was containedearlier this month. Mr Szepe said the loss of his chickens and themassive clean-up operationtook an emotional and financial toll on his family and business. ""It's been very emotional — our team were devastated and to see that loss of birds euthanased on such a scale is completely gut-wrenching and very traumatic,"" he said. ""We took all possible precautions in terms of managing the welfare and biosecurity of our birds at all times … but it's been pretty tumultuous. Mr Szepe said the quarantine process was ""like a scene out of CSI"". ""People were in full biohazard suits, washing down areas, which was pretty intimidating, but that's what's necessary to managing the response and ensure we contained the virus to that area,"" he said. When the business returns to full production by mid-September it will supply 1.2 million eggs per day to supermarkets. ""Retail shelves are now a lot fuller than what they have been, reflecting the recovery process with some of the farms affected by the prior outbreak just coming back to full production,"" Mr Szepe said. Kinross Farms was in the process ofbeing purchasedby New South Wales-based egg producer Pace Farm at the time of the outbreak. The sale is expected to be finalised within weeks. ""Pace Farms supported us getting back into production as soon as possible with replacement birds they had available and they'd had similar experiences in the past, so they knew what was involved and there's no one to blame for what eventuated,"" Mr Szepe said. Multiple variants of avian influenza are present in Australia's wild bird population and can spread into commercial poultry farms directly from chickens being exposed to wildlife or from poor biosecurity practices such as dirty footwear. Australia is the only continent that has not been hit with the H5N1 subtype of the disease, which isspreading among multiple animals internationally. Mr Szepe is acutely aware of the threat the strain poses. ""All you need is wild ducks or waterfowl to frequent the ranging area and you've got the potential for transmission … we believe that's what happened, despite our best endeavours and leading edge technology,"" he said. ""We also have artificial intelligence lasers that detect ducks and then frighten them away with a high-resolution light. ""Any person who enters our farms has to go through a shower facility, leave street clothes outside and put on our uniforms and, if you have personal items such as a phone or glasses, they have to be UV sanitised."""
McBride lodges High Court application to challenge conviction,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/david-mcbride-seeks-high-court-leave-to-challenge-conviction/105461954,2025-06-26,"Former military lawyer David McBride has lodged a special leave application in the High Court in a bid to challenge his conviction forsharing classified material with journalists. The ACT Supreme Court jailed McBride for five years and eight months for theft and leaking the material to three journalists. He was to face a jury but pleaded guilty when it became evident the court would not allow his basic defence that it was his duty to share the documents in the public interest. His point was that soldiers in Afghanistan were being ""over-investigated"" for alleged war crimes and he wanted the public to know. McBride appealed against his sentence and conviction, but that was thrown out earlier this year. His High Court appeal canvasses the same issues, drawing a distinction between disciplinary duties and duties of office, and relying on the Oath of Allegiance to the Sovereign. The oath, which McBride made to Queen Elizabeth II, includes a promise to serve the sovereign according to law, and ""… faithfully discharge my duty according to law"". The appeal centres on the scope of that duty. His lawyers say in their submissions to the High Court, that the ACT Court of Appeal ""… erroneously assumed that a duty of service requires unqualified obedience to orders"". The appeal court remarked that if it accepted McBride's argument it would ""… also extend to conduct of members in all spheres of a member's military service, including on the battlefield"". McBride's lawyers say in their High Court application they are not encouraging general defiance of orders, but rather suggesting it should be recognised ""duty cannot be reduced to blind obedience"". ""… the applicant sought to communicate to the public evidence of serious misconduct at the highest levels of military command."" the submissions to the High Court say. ""An insistence that duty is wholly defined by orders strips away the necessary safeguard against executive overreach and ignores the principle that duty is judged by law, not merely military command."" The application even cites the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal after the Second World War ""which recognised following orders is no defence to actions that violate fundamental principles of law, such as crimes against humanity"". ""There must be circumstances where a soldier can and indeed must, disobey orders — even if those orders are authorised pursuant to military law."" Only the ABC used the material David McBride provided, in a series called the Afghan Files, which revealed allegations Australian soldiers were involved in illegal killings in Afghanistan. This was not, of course, what David McBride had hoped to achieve by handing over the documents. He had begun copying the material, printing it and taking it home in 2013. A search showed he had removed 235 documents, 207 of which had a secret classification. McBride knew for a long time he would face charges. During the investigation the ABC was raided by Australian Federal Police looking for evidence in the case. It was not until 2019 that he finally appeared in the ACT Magistrates Court, with even longer to wait for trial, after interruptions from the pandemic. He is now in Canberra's jail. It is not known when the High Court will consider the application."
Satellite photos reveal hundreds of illegal dams in SA region,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/illegal-dams-revealed-mount-lofty-ranges-adelaide-hills/105450582,2025-06-26,"Aerial imagery has found hundreds of illegal dams have been built or enlarged in the Adelaide Hills over the past 10 years. About 400 new dams have been built in the Mount Lofty Ranges, and about 300 significantly enlarged, without approval. This has occurred despite a moratorium on building new dams in the ranges since 2013. Hills and Fleurieu Landscape Board general manager Michael Garrod said the organisation was aware of some illegal dams, but he was surprised by the scale of the problem. ""Many of the catchments in the Mount Lofty Ranges were already over-allocated and under some stress, so these new dams that have been built without authorisation will deny water getting to those legitimate dam owners,"" Mr Garrod said. There are 22,000 legitimate dams in the Mount Lofty Ranges. Mr Garrod said, despite thedrought putting pressure on water in the Adelaide Hills, there had not been a particular uptick in illegal dams in the last two years. The landscape board has been working with landholders to either reduce the total volume of water being captured on a property to the amount before the illegal dam was built or require them to remove it. Mr Garrod said with drier and more variable conditions, fair and responsible water management was more important than ever. ""We have to find new and better ways of storing and using water, building more dams and losing more to evaporation is just a recipe to less water for everybody,"" he said. Given the need for landholders to be resilient to the changing climate, Mr Garrod said using groundwater more might be an option. ""Our groundwater resources are in much better shape than our surface water resources, so that would be a logical change,"" he said. Kangaroo Island (KI) was the other hotspot with about 350 unauthorised dams also detected, after changes were made to dam building in 2017 when the current water plan came into force. AgKI chair Peter Cooper said the organisation was aware of the issue. Mr Cooper said before 2017, dams on Kangaroo Island that held less than 5 megalitres did not require approval, so some people had built dams not realising that rule had changed. ""So this process has been a lot about the education about how the regulations work and what needs to happen into the future,"" Mr Cooper said. Mr Cooper said given the lack of groundwater, dams were vital for primary production on the island. The Kangaroo Island Landscape Board has written to landholders who built dams that were not authorised but would have been if they had sought approval to explain what they should have done. However, the 10 landholders who built dams that would not have been approved have not yet been contacted. ""We (AgKI) have asked that that be delayed until we have an opening to the season to reduce the stress farmers need to have upon them in the season that we've had,"" Mr Cooper. Sustainable landscapes manager Jo Sullivan said the landscape board had never intended to start any compliance work until the season had broken. She said the main motivation for the work was to improve the understanding of the rules. ""We really encourage the community to contact us if they have questions or concerns about construction of dams or water availability on their property,"" Mr Sullivan said. Compliance officers are continuing to review dams, and an automated change detection system is being developed to allow the landscape boards to identify new and enlarged dams more easily than in the past."
"As gas use declines, those remaining could foot bigger bills",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/declining-gas-usage-changes-pipeline-business-model-raises-costs/105460248,2025-06-26,"Clare Savage might be reluctant to acknowledge she is something of a veteran of Australia's energy industry. But for more than 20 years, she has held senior positions within it, including the past six as the chair of the industry's top watchdog — the Australian Energy Regulator (AER). During that time, many things have transformed. Governments and ministers have come and gone, policies have chopped and changed, and the very mix of Australia's biggest electricity system has been radically reshaping. There has also been another, fundamental shift in Australia's energy landscape. Australian households are using less gas, with some getting off the fuel entirely. When it comes to the business of gas pipelines — how much they are worth, how they are regulated, who pays for them and how — Ms Savage says this trend changes everything. ""The whole gas regulatory framework was built upon the belief that you would have a growing network,"" Ms Savage says. ""And so all of the tools that we have, or most of the tools that we have, are founded on the belief that we'll have a growing network and that sharing the fixed costs of a network amongst a growing customer base is the best possible thing to do."" Indeed, official and unofficial forecasts show declines to varying degrees in the number of customers connected to Australia's various gas networks. According to the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), the body which runs the country's power and gas markets, a tipping point is at hand. The agency forecasts the number of household and business customers connected to gas networks is set to fall from almost 5 million now, to barely 4 million by 2030. AEMO says this number will collapse to as few as 1.5 million by the middle of the 2040s. Experts says a precipitous decline in gas connections will completely break the model used to regulate the networks. Under that model, gas pipeline owners are able to recover the huge cost of buying or building their networks — plus a profit margin — by charging a ""fair"" price to everyone connected to the network. How those prices are set, and the way they are apportioned to consumers, is determined by regulators. Ms Savage says the model had always been based on the notion there would be more customers joining the network. Courtesy of that assumption, she explains there are cross-subsidies that have helped keep costs low and encouraged ever more connections. Among them is a subsidy — paid by all existing users — that makes the cost of a new connection artificially low. Ms Savage says this way of regulating the industry and allowing pipeline owners to get their money back had worked relatively well — while the number of connections grew. ""Then when we find ourselves with a customer base that might be changing or shifting or shrinking through time, we find that we've got less tools available,"" she says. ""From that perspective, it makes the job harder."" Faced for the first time with falling connection numbers, regulators including the AER are turning to novel ways of determining a ""fair"" price for owners and consumers alike. One of those tools is increasingly in vogue — and increasingly controversial. It is called accelerated depreciation and refers to the accounting treatment in which a company is able to fast-track the process of writing down the value of an asset. Crucially, by writing down the value of the asset in this way, the owner can pass on the cost to the consumer. And the costs can be considerable — hundreds of millions of dollars for the business and hundreds of dollars for individual consumers over a five-year period. While consumer groups have railed against its increasing use, retailers are not happy, either. Jeff Dimery is the longstanding boss of Alinta Energy, which is one of Australia's biggest electricity and gas providers. Mr Dimery says he can understand the arguments for accelerated depreciation — he just does not think gas companies should be allowed to write down their assets so quickly. ""We would certainly encourage regulators to consider and to revisit accelerated depreciation on the basis of how smooth and how quickly this transition to a low carbon economy is actually occurring,"" Mr Dimery says. ""We've been on the public record saying that we think the transition is behind schedule. For his part, Mr Dimery questions whether people will disconnect from the gas network as quickly or in as many numbers as authorities are forecasting. He notes that in some cases, pipeline owners are seeking to bring forward the lifetimes of their assets dramatically. However, he thinks the transition away from gas will happen more gradually. And for industrial customers that rely on gas to make their products, he says the shift could take many decades. As such, Mr Dimery says pipeline companies' depreciation claims should be treated with caution. ""I think an important element of that also then needs to be the pace of change and this transition,"" the Alinta CEO says. ""Let's not run down the hill here and stumble, let's walk down the hill and get it right. ""And if that means that we take a longer-term view of these assets and there's a slightly slower transition and that eases the burden on consumers during a cost-of-living crisis, we don't think that's a bad thing."" Ms Savage insists the AER is taking a tough approach. She points out that, collectively, pipeline owners have asked for as much as $800 million in accelerated depreciation. But she says the regulator has barely given them half of that. ""We are, of course, balancing the needs of network businesses and consumers,"" Ms Savage says. ""That's our job."" Pipeline companies are sticking to their guns. Australian Pipelines and Gas Association chief Steve Davies says falling gas use is a real issue for owners, particularly distribution networks that service smaller customers like households. Mr Davies notes pipelines are typically built to last at least 40 years and there was little doubt that much could — or would — change in that timeframe. He says pipeline companies are not seeking to price gouge or generate windfall profits but simply recover their costs in a reasonable way and within a reasonable time. ""We need to encourage infrastructure investment in Australia,"" Mr Davies says. ""The regulator sets those rates of returns. They are acceptable and in line with the risk associated with investing in utility infrastructure, which is fairly low. ""But we are talking about the recovery of the money that has been put into these infrastructure assets and that is a separate question from the rates of return which you achieve when you invest in the assets. ""So there's return of capital and return on capital."" Mr Davies argues the use of accelerated depreciation reflects the fact the regulatory system for gas pipelines was not designed for the circumstances it now faced. To that end, he suggests a broader shake-up of the system is needed. ""In this changing environment, this is a challenge that hasn't been faced in Australia before,"" he says. ""It is a fundamental question that needs to be managed properly."" On this point, Ms Savage from the Australian Energy Regulator firmly agrees. Ms Savage says the watchdog was among the first of its global peers to recognise the implications for regulators of the shift away from gas. Chiefly, she says, the trend risks saddling an ever diminishing group of users with the full cost of building and maintaining a vast and expensive network of gas pipelines. Worse still, she says many of those household users who will be left picking up the tab are those unwilling or unable to get off gas and electrify. She says the regulator will continue to ""use the tools we have available under the current … framework"". Ultimately, though, it would like to see a revamp in the way the industry was overseen. ""Our job is to worry about not just the consumers we have today, but the consumers we're going to have in 5, 10, 15 and 20 years' time, and 50 years' time,"" Ms Savage says. ""How much should a connecting customer pay to the gas network? ""What kind of contribution should a new customer make towards the assets that are being invested in on their behalf? ""We think that's a really interesting and very important question to get to the bottom of."""
Uni cops sanctions warning after Iran state media attended event on campus,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/uni-may-have-breached-sanctions-iran-state-media/105460408,2025-06-26,"A Sydney university has been warned about a possible breach of Australian sanctions on Iran over a controversial event held on campus earlier this year. The Australian Sanctions Office investigated the event held at Western Sydney University as a possible breach of sanctions placed on PressTV, an English-language state media outlet run out of Iran. In February, the Benevolent Iranian Women's Association held an International Women's Day event at the university's South Parramatta campus, aimed at ""addressing misconceptions"" about the status of women in Iran. It was attended by independent senator Fatima Payman, who gave an interview to PressTV which was subsequently edited and published on the organisation's social media channels. Senator Payman laterapologised for her commentsthat suggested Iran was an ""incredible place"" for women. The comments were condemned by Australian-based advocates for women in Iran and prompted questions about why PressTV was seemingly operating freely in Australia. Kylie Moore-Gilbert, a political scientist who spent two years detained in Iran, said PressTV's coverage of the event put ""the integrity of the entire sanctions regime into question"". PressTV has been a sanctioned entity in Australia for nearly two years, which essentially prohibits financial dealings with the state broadcaster. It was sanctioned over its broadcast of forced confessions, the announcement of which was timed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of Iran's morality police detaining 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who would eventually die in custody. The sanctions office investigated the event earlier this year and the matter was raised with Department of Foriegn Affairs and Trade officials during estimates hearings in the weeks after it was held. It led to ""corrective action"" being taken, which can include formal warnings, monitoring of transactions being stepped up, or tighter restrictions on trade permits. The sanctions office does not ordinarily detail steps taken to enforce sanctions, but Western Sydney University has confirmed it was issued an informal warning. A university spokesperson maintained it did not know PressTV was attending the campus or the full nature of the event at the time it was booked. ""The university was contacted by the Australian Sanctions Office,"" they said. ""This was not a Western Sydney University event. Organisers hired a university venue, informing us it was for an International Women's Day event. The university was not told that PressTV would be attending. ""Notwithstanding the circumstances of the booking, the Australian Sanctions Office has provided an informal warning to the university. ""The university has cooperated fully with the Australian Sanctions Office and the university has taken measures to prevent a similar incident from occurring."" It is not known if other actions or warnings have been issued to others involved in the event, but sources have told the ABC that Senator Payman has not been issued a warning. A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it could not comment on specific incidents. ""The Australian government takes sanctions compliance seriously. The Australian Sanctions Office is Australia's sanctions regulator and performs independent evaluations of compliance,"" they said. ""It is the longstanding practice of successive Australian governments not to comment on individual sanctions compliance matters."""
Cable theft in France disrupts train travel between London and Paris,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/cable-theft-affecting-eurostar-between-paris-and-london/105461956,2025-06-26,"More than 600 metres of cable along train tracks has been stolen in northern France, wrecking havoc for Eurostar trips between London and Paris. French railway operator, SNCF, said ""more than 600 metres of cable were stolen or severed south of the Lille Europe station"" on Wednesday, local time, between the two European capitals. About 15 workers, including cable layers, were dispatched to solve the issue, but repairs were expected to take a good part of the day, the operator added. In Lille's southern district of Mont-de-Terre, AFP saw workers in orange vests placing cables back along the railway. They worked to reconnected dozens of multicoloured cables one by one inside thick tubes. Contacted by AFP, the police did not immediately provide more details on the cable theft. The Eurostar website showed that six trips between London and Paris — three in each direction — were cancelled on Wednesday, while other trains were still expected to run. Several trips between London and Brussels were also delayed. ""Due to a cable theft near Lille Europe, our trains are likely to be subject to severe delays and last-minute cancellations,"" Eurostar said, advising passengers to cancel or postpone their trip free of charge. It was the second day of disruptions after ""two persons struck by trains near Lille Europe"" upset traffic on Tuesday evening. Eurostar spokeswoman Juliette Clement told AFP trains were for the moment ""being redirected via secondary routes, which increases travel times"". Several passengers took to social media platforms to vent their frustration. ""My journey out was cancelled due to 'technical difficulties'. Return now cancelled due to a fatality,"" one user who appeared to be in Paris wrote on Tuesday evening. ""My rescheduled train is cancelled again. No seats today Paris to London,"" they added in a new post on Wednesday morning. SNCF said about 10 high-speed train trips between Lille and the French capital had also been cancelled. At the train station in Lille, 51-year-old Belgian holiday-maker Marie-Line Ponville was deeply disappointed. She and her daughter had been planning to board a ship in Marseille for a week-long cruise around the Mediterranean but look likely to miss the boat's departure. AFP"
South Korean court rejects arrest warrant for ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/south-korea-rejects-arrest-warrant-ex-president-yoon-suk-yeol/105462032,2025-06-26,"A South Korean court has rejected a request to issue an arrest warrant for former president Yoon Suk Yeol related to an investigation into his short-lived attempt to impose martial law, his lawyers said. South Korea's special prosecutor had asked the court on Tuesday to issue an arrest warrant for Mr Yoon as an investigation intensified over the ousted leader's botched bid to declare martial law. A spokesperson for the Seoul Central District Court and the prosecution office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A senior member of the special prosecutor's team of investigators said the arrest warrant was on a charge of obstruction and accused Mr Yoon of refusing to respond to a summons for questioning. Lawyers representing Mr Yoon criticised the special prosecutor for what they said were attempts to summon the former president ""based on superficial and secondary matters that invited suspicion the probe was politically driven"". His legal team said Mr Yoon would comply with another summons and appear for questioning on Saturday. The special prosecutor had said it would consider seeking another arrest warrant if Mr Yoon failed to turn up for questioning on Saturday, the Yonhap News Agency reported. Mr Yoon, who is already facing a criminal trial on insurrection charges for issuing the martial law declaration, was arrested in January after resisting authorities trying to take him into custody, but was released after 52 days on technical grounds. The former president is fighting charges that include masterminding insurrection, which is punishable by death or life in prison. He maintains that he declared martial law on December 3 to sound the alarm over the threat to democracy posed by the then-opposition Democratic Party. The special prosecutor was appointed just days after liberal President Lee Jae-myung took office on June 4 following his victory in a snap election. The prosecutor has launched a team of more than 200 prosecutors and investigators to take over ongoing investigations into Mr Yoon. Separately, the Seoul Central District Court issued a warrant on Wednesday for Mr Yoon's former defence minister, Kim Yong-hyun, to extend his detention, citing concerns over potential destruction of evidence. Mr Kim played a leading role in recommending and planning martial law, and is in jail amid an ongoing trial on insurrection charges. He has denied wrongdoing and said imposing martial law was intended to raise alarm over the opposition's dominance and gather information related to election fraud concerns. Reuters"
Pokies pre-commitment card won't go ahead without 'national approach',https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/tasmania-gambling-pre-commitment-cards-poker-machines-on-hold/105457656,2025-06-26,"Mandatory pre-commitment cards for poker machine players won't be introduced in Tasmania unless other states and territories agree to a national approach on the issue, Premier Jeremy Rockliff says. The Liberal government first announced plans for the ""nation-leading"" harm-minimisation measurein 2022. The cashless cards would have capped losses at $100 per day or $5,000 per year. The scheme was originally expected to be implemented by the end of 2024. But in February last year, the government revealed it would not be in place until the end of 2025. Then, in November last year,Mr Rockliff announced an indefinite pause, citing the complexity and cost of putting the scheme into place. Mr Rockliff, who is facing an election next month, has now gone further, saying the policy will not be implemented unless other jurisdictions support an Australia-wide scheme. ""In the meantime, we recognise the importance of continuing with harm minimisation, such as third-party exclusion, such as facial technology."" Victoria recently delayedthe rollout of its own version of a pre-commitment card scheme, whileNew South Wales is still consideringthe best way to implement a cashless system. Mr Rockliff said it would be ""very sensible"" for all jurisdictions to work together. ""We are keeping a close eye on other states, but what will be most effective is a national approach in a policy sense, and implementation sense in this issue."" Labor leader Dean Winter, who is hoping to become premier after the July 19 election, said his party would be taking a similar approach. ""We'll look at what happens in other states and territories, but we won't be going first,"" Mr Winter said. The decision not to forge ahead with the policy has been criticised by advocates of the cashless card system. ""It's disappointing to hear the premier saying that they'll sit back and wait to see what other states do on a cashless gaming card,"" Greens candidate for Bass, Cecily Rosol, said. ""We are missing the chance to help people now and to provide support and to address the problem of gambling in Tasmania. ""Tasmania had the opportunity to be nation-leading with this card and we've thrown that opportunity away."" Independent candidate for Clark, Kristie Johnston, said the poker machine industry was being prioritised ahead of people impacted by gambling addiction. She urged both major parties to reverse their current stance and introduce mandatory pre-commitment cards during the first 12 months of the next government."
Sussan Ley's press club address marks tone shift for Liberals,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/sussan-ley-marks-a-tone-shift-for-liberals-in-press-club-address/105458470,2025-06-25,"Sussan Ley has set the tone for how she will seek to rebuild the Liberal Party, opening a major address to the National Press Club with an acknowledgement of country and a vow that she is someone who respects the public service. The comments were nods to policies the Coalition took to a federal election that saw it wipe-out and nearly completely lose its footing in Australia's metro areas. In her first address as leader to the press club, which was snubbed for several years by former leader Peter Dutton, Ms Ley spelled out that the Liberal Party would look different under her watch. The Liberal leader acknowledged the party had not just lost, ""we got smashed"", and what had been presented to Australian voters was ""comprehensively rejected"". The party is now reviewing its election loss, as well as undertaking a deeper review of its future, with one key issue being its falling representation of women in parliament and the ongoing internal struggle over whether to introduce quotas to forcibly lift it. Ms Ley put her party on notice that she was ""agnostic"" about how to improve the party's representation of women, but a ""zealot"" in seeing that it happened, and would not accept state branches who did not improve. ""If some state divisions choose to implement quotas, that is fine. If others don't, that is also fine,"" she said. ""But what is not fine is not having enough women. As the first woman leader of our federal party, let me send the clearest possible message: We need to do better, recruit better, retain better and support better."" Over the next two days the Liberal party room, the shadow ministry and shadow cabinet will meet in their first formal opportunities to discuss those party reviews. As part of the Coalition's reset, Ms Ley said a dedicated working group was also being stood up to nut out one of the thorniest issues for the party: its energy and emissions reduction policies. The Coalition campaigned on a promise to build seven nuclear power plants over the coming decades, which would have been a major shift in Australia's energy network. After its election loss, theNationals briefly broke from the Liberal Partyover an initial refusal to re-endorse nuclear power before it was examined by the Coalition's post-loss review. And anongoing internal struggle over climate policycontinues to roil within the Coalition. After former prime minister Scott Morrison finally negotiated an agreement with the Nationals to sign on to net zero emissions by 2050, the party is now again openly questioning whether to keep that commitment, with some Nationals MPs publicly advocating it be dumped. Ms Ley said the working group would be led by opposition energy spokesman Dan Tehan, and include Shadow Treasurer Ted O'Brien, opposition resources spokeswoman Susan McDonald, manager of opposition business Alex Hawke, opposition environment spokeswoman Angie Bell, and Dean Smith and Andrew Willcox. That group will report directly to Ms Ley and Nationals leader David Littleproud, tasked with developing a policy with two focuses: a ""stable"" and ""affordable"" energy grid and reducing emissions so Australia is playing its part in the global effort. In a call for stability after only narrowly winning the Liberal leadership over challenger Angus Taylor, Ms Ley also asked the room of Liberals that she be judged not on the ""headlines nor polling of the day"", but on the next federal election result in 2028. Recounting her personal story, Ms Ley noted her own history in the public service, tacitly acknowledging the party's unpopular promise at the election to slash the public service and force staff back to the office — a policy itdumped in an astonishing mid-campaign jettisonafter it was received poorly by voters. ""Before entering parliament, I worked at the Australian Tax Office. That role gave me a firsthand understanding of how our tax system works and, often, how it doesn't,"" Ms Ley said. ""It reinforced my view that economic management must be responsible, practical and always focused on delivering value to the taxpayer. ""It also reinforced something I learned as the child of an intelligence officer: a deep and abiding respect for the public service. That is part of my story too."" In another subtle nod, Ms Ley opened her address with an acknowledgement to traditional owners, marking a shift after Mr Dutton said during the election campaign he believedIndigenous acknowledgements were sometimes ""overdone"". In the first press club address by a Liberal leader in several years, Ms Ley said voters' rejection of her party at the election was not lost on her or her colleagues. ""As we seek to regain trust with all voters across our great country, the task before me — and my team — is to lead a Liberal Party that respects modern Australia, reflects modern Australia and represents modern Australia,"" Ms Ley said. While the party is continuing to rework its policies, Ms Ley did name a handful of priorities for this term. The opposition leader insisted that Australia must further lift its defence spending as global instability erodes further. The United States hasdemanded Australia lift its defence spending to 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product, or about an extra $40 billion a year if enacted immediately, well beyond the government's current plan to lift defence spending from 2 per cent to 2.33 per cent over the next eight years. Ms Ley said addressing family violence and child safety was another major concern for her this term. ""I understand the fear you feel when you go for a walk alone because I have felt that fear too. I understand the pain that comes with coercion and control because I have felt that pain too,"" Ms Ley said. ""I will never let domestic and family violence fall down the list of priorities. ""Prime minister, when it comes to standing up for women and children, I am ready to work with you."" The Liberal leader also pointed to tech giants she said were making billions of dollars ""peddling addictive technology"" to children, and artificial intelligence technologies that ""commoditise our kids and deep fakes [that] ruin the lives of women"". Ms Ley concluded that the Coalition must offer an agenda that builds aspiration and rewards aspiration, and that reconnects with Australians."
Sussan Ley prepared to be 'zealot' to preselect more Liberal women — as it happened,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/federal-politics-live-blog-june-25/105456916,2025-06-25,"Opposition Leader Sussan Ley says she is prepared to be a ""zealot"" to get more women preselected in winnable seats for the Liberal Party because current approaches have not worked. In her first address to the National Press Club as Liberal leader, Ms Ley said she was open to state divisions taking any effective approach, but ""what is not fine is not having enough women"". Look back at how the day unfolded in our live blog."
First Nations leaders urge PM to convene national cabinet on prison crisis,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/nt-justice-conference-alice-springs-indigenous-incarceration/105455924,2025-06-25,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been urged to convene national cabinet to address First Nations deaths in custody and incarceration, as justice leaders, experts and community voices meet today in Alice Springs. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains the name of an Indigenous person who has died, used with the permission of their family. Their discussions will include a focus on what children's commissioners are calling the ""disturbing erosion of hard-won safeguards intended to shield Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from institutional harm"" across Australia. The two-day annual meeting, organised by the Justice Reform Initiative (JRI), follows a series of changes around the country to youth justice, bail and policing pitched at community safety, which advocates say disproportionately affect First Nations adults and children. JRI chair Robert Tickner — who was the federal Aboriginal affairs minister during the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in custody — said ""things have gotten worse"" in the 34 years since the royal commission findings were handed down. ""At this particular point in time we're at the lowest point we've been,"" he said. ""This is the matter for our prime minister and I have a great respect for his integrity and his compassion, but on this issue I beg of him to show initiative to get this issue before national cabinet."" Less than a month ago,Warlpiri man Kumanjayi White died in police custodyafter he was restrained on the floor of an Alice Springs supermarket. Mr White's death has promptedcalls for an independent investigationand for federal action to prevent further deaths in custody, particularly of First Nations people. Mr White's grandfather, senior Warlpiri elder Ned Jampijinpa Hargraves, haswritten to the prime ministerrequesting the Commonwealth withhold funding to the NT until it independently investigates his death and establishes a police integrity commission. He also supportedcalls for the federal government to implement all recommendationsfrom the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. Adult and youth justice in Australia are overseen by state and territory governments, but pressure has been growing for the federal government to play a greater role. Productivity Commission data shows Australia is not on track to meet its youth incarceration target under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap, and the nation is going backwards on its adult incarceration targets. Anindependent, Indigenous-led review into Closing the Gaprecently found ""limited evidence that governments are making any systemic changes to meet [their] commitments"". First Nations leaders are urging the federal government to tie state and territory funding to reforms that close the gap, including Catherine Liddle, the head of advocacy body Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (SNAICC). ""At the centre of that storm are children and in particular are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children."" Ahead of the Alice Springs conference, a group of children's commissioners also urged the federal government to take ""immediate action"" to improve the states and territories' accountability for meeting those targets. The commissioners — who are part of the Australian and New Zealand Children's Commissioners, Guardians and Advocates (ANZCCGA) First Nations Caucus — also warnedAustralia is breaching its international obligationsunder the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. ""These are not symbolic gestures. They are binding commitments,"" the group said in a statement. In just over the past year, theVictorian,Queensland,NSWandNT governmentshave each passed changes expanding the circumstances under which children and teenagers can be held in custody, with South Australia recently releasing a ""young offender plan"" highlighting potential areas for reform. The ANZCCGA commissioners have urged the federal government to enshrine Australia's obligations under the UN treaty into domestic law, urgently establish a national children's minister, and pass a human rights act. NT Children's Commissioner Shahleena Musk said the demands were about ""holding governments to account"". ""The Commonwealth government needs to step in [and it] can't walk away from these rights,"" she said."
Thirteen-year-old Abed died weeks after shrapnel ripped through him in Gaza,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/uncief-warns-of-gaza-water-crisis-children-dying-of-thirst/105460354,2025-06-25,"The screams of injured children who can no longer access painkillers fill the air in Gaza, where UNICEF spokesperson James Elder says ""daily atrocities"" are not only being committed but have escalated in the past fortnight. Mr Elder told 7.30 Gaza is facing multiple crises, even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his nation will continue its war there until the nation's objectives are completed. Mr Elder says water is now scarce, may run out in just a fortnight and could result in children dying of thirst. Children in Gaza though are already dying, with aMay UNICEF report stating 50,000 children had been injured or killedsince Israel's response to Hamas's October 7, 2023 terror attack. The UNICEF spokesperson recounted the story of one child who had died after sustaining injuries near an aid site. ""I went to a hospital and I met a little 13-year-old boy, he'd been given money just to go and buy bread for his family,"" Mr Elder recounted. ""He saw a flood of people going to one of these [aid] sites and thought 'my goodness, my family, I can end my mum's starvation pain'. ""A tank shell exploded and ripped through his stomach. ""When I met this little boy, he was telling his story and his dad's in tears. ""Finally, after my two weeks in Gaza on my final day, this little guy, Abed Al Rahman, died of those injuries, died trying to get food for his family. ""This is not a one off. This is happening consistently and will continue to because it's a combat site."" The latest such incident allegedly occurred earlier on Wednesday when19 people were reported to have been killed while trying to access aid in the central Gaza city of Nuseirat. Mr Elder says these incidents are emblematic of a rapidly worsening situation in Gaza, where aid stations are placed in combat sites, causing those living there to face even more danger as they attempt to procure essentials. ""There is a handful of sites and they're militarised,"" he said. ""The United Nations has made very clear there is reason why you cannot have one party to a conflict handing out aid to those it chooses in a combat site — because it's a combat site. ""We have now seen reports of 400-500 hundred people killed around these distribution points. People go there because they are being starved [and] they're forced to go to these sites. ""They were described to me like The Hunger Games [people] corralled into like cattle pens and then there's firing, there's tank shells. ""And then when there is a mass killing, it is explained away by the IDF as, 'It was a combat site.' Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Sharren Haskel last week denied that there was any starvation occurring in Gaza during an appearance on 7.30. ""Every report that came out was mentioning that this is a possibility for a future scenario — like an imminent threat, or anything like that,"" Ms Haskel said. ""It means that it could happen in the future but we're monitoring it up closely."" Mr Elder says things are much worse than that and that the water situation is dire. ""Two things strike me beyond beyond the grave situation of civilians there,"" Mr Elder said. ""One is water, there's been a complete denial of any fuel to come in for the desalinating plants for 100 days. ""We are weeks away from children dying of thirst. ""And the other ... I think of all the things being deprived from going into Gaza ... it's painkillers. ""I never get used to seeing those little girls and boys with the burns or the shrapnel [wounds] but this time around I heard them. ""This is utterly avoidable. This is not logistical, this is political. We could change this within 24 hours by allowing medicines and fuel and so on. ""Children's bodies are not waiting for some technical declaration in Gaza.""

Australia joins UK to assert right to navigate in South China Sea with joint navy exercises,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/australia-navy-joins-uk-freedom-of-navigation-south-china-sea/105460748,2025-06-25,"An Australian naval destroyer has joined a British patrol vessel to conduct a freedom of navigation exercise in the South China Sea, in another sign Australia's military remains intent on pushing back on Beijing's claims over the contested waters. The UK Defence Ministry's Permanent Joint Headquarters publicised the operation on social media on Tuesday — although the Australian Defence Force has not announced it publicly and has not yet responded to the ABC's questions about the activity. ""HMS SPEY and HMAS SYDNEY have just conducted Freedom of Navigation Activity around the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, in accordance with UNCLOS,"" it said on the social media site X. The two countries conducted the drill while much of the world's attention remains focused on the US strikes on Iran and the threat of a broader conflagration in the Middle East. Beijing claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea as its territory —despite a 2016 international rulingwhich found that claim invalid — and its navy and coast guard have repeatedly clashed with vessels from the Philippines, which is one of the South-East Asian nations which also has overlapping claims in the sea. China and the Philippines have also had several potentially dangerous aerial encounters over the South China Sea, including in February, when China's military said it had expelled three Philippine aircraft from the Spratly Islands. Australia has conducted freedom of navigation activities in the South China Sea with an expanding number of countries, including the US, Japan, Canada and the Philippines — which have all shown increasing resolve to assert their right to sail through the waters. But Euan Graham from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said it appeared to be the first time that the United Kingdom and Australia had conducted a publicly flagged freedom of navigation operation in the South China Sea by themselves. He said both countries were ""pushing back against China's excessive maritime claims and thickening military presence in the South China Sea"" by asserting their right to navigation. Mr Graham said Canberra was signalling that China's recent partial circumnavigation of the Australian mainland would not deter it from continuing to operate in the South China Sea. Multiple Chinese analysts have suggested that Beijing was using the deployment to Australia to discourage the federal government from sending naval vessels into waters near China. ""There's a sense that Australia is stepping up its game and being present (in the South China Sea) at a time when China's navy is exerting its presence close to Australia,"" Mr Graham said. The United Kingdom and Australia have already been stepping up joint naval activities in the region — including by taking part in an operation to enforce United Nations sanctions on North Korea. In February British and Australian shipsalso joined the United States Navy in the South China Seato conduct a ""coordinated manoeuvring exercise"", and last week China lashed the United Kingdom after HMS Spey flagged that it was sailing through the Taiwan Strait. The British government has said that HMAS Sydney and HMS Spey will now sail to Singapore, where they will meet with the United Kingdom's carrier Prince of Wales and a Strike Group with a host of navy ships from the UK, Canada, Norway, New Zealand and Spain. The Carrier Strike Group will then sail down to the Northern Territory to join Operation Talisman Sabre — massive Australia-US joint military exercises which will also draw in forces from more than a dozen other nations. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says the deployment of the carrier and other British naval vessels to the region — along with around 4,000 UK military personnel — is aimed at ""sending a clear message of strength to our adversaries, and a message of unity and purpose to our allies""."
Iranian Australians share their agony amid shaky ceasefire with Israel,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/iranian-australians-in-fear-amid-shaky-ceasefire-with-israel/105432102,2025-06-25,"Australian residents with family in Iran are living in a state of constant anxiety. Despite an apparent ceasefire between Iran and Israel, the fragile nature of the situation means many people are still worried about the safety of their loved ones and some are calling for help to get them out of the country. Bahar Chaichi, who moved to Australia from Iran 13 years ago to pursue her career as an engineer, said she felt like she was a world away. ""Most of the time we feel guilty that we are sitting here in Australia in such a safe, lovely, beautiful place,"" she said. Ms Chaichi is the president of the Australian Iranian Community of the NSW city of Newcastle, and is one of more than 85,000 Iranians living in Australia. It has been more than a week sinceIsrael launched a surprise attack on Iran,killing leaders, scientists and civilians. Since then Iran and Israel havetraded missile strikesand the United States entered the conflict, launching an attack on Iranian nuclear sites. A ceasefire has since been agreed to by both countries buttensions remain high. Amineh Pirouzi has watched the violence with horror, fearing for her daughter Mahdiah who still lives in Tehran, with her three children and her husband. ""I fear that my daughter will die of stress and fear,"" Ms Pirouzi said. ""No-one understands my pain and suffering."" Ms Pirouzi has been unable to sleep and has missed days of work. The Australian citizen moved to Iran from Afghanistan when she was two, coming to Australia in 2014 and now living on the NSW Mid North Coast. She hopes the ceasefire will provide an opportunity to get her daughter out. Last year, Mahdiah and her family applied to migrate to Australia under the Community Support Program, but no decision has been made on their application. ""I plead with the Australian government to help my daughter flee as soon as possible,"" Ms Pirouzi said. Some Iranians in Australia hope that the conflict will help prompt regime change. Iranian refugees Azin Naghibi and Hesan Orouji travelled to Australia in 2013. They say they were targeted by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Mr Orouji is a member of Iran's Novin Party, which hopes to install the descendant of the last Shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, as the country's head of state. He said the war was an opportunity for a change of government. ""This is the only historic chance we have to not be killed by the Islamic Regime again and again,"" he said. The couple have family in Iran's capital who have chosen not to evacuate despite warnings from the United States and Israel. Ms Naghibi said she had heard people say they wanted to stay in the hope they would witness the fall of the Islamic regime. ""They tell us, 'I want to watch it, I want to be there when it happens,'"" she said. ""The people of Iran don't deserve this, but the hope is greater than all of that."" Bahar Chaichi said ultimately, it would be civilians who suffered. ""Like any other wars, obviously, people, normal people, were not in the decision-making process to initiate the wars,"" she said. She said Iranian people had survived past wars and would persevere in the face of the latest crisis. ""We've been attacked so many times, for so many reasons, by so many names, by so many nations,"" she said."
US sanctions Mexican banks for allegedly laundering money for drug cartels,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/us-sanctions-mexican-banks-for-allegedly-laundering-money/105462344,2025-06-26,"The US Treasury has slapped three Mexican financial institutions with sanctions, accusing them of laundering millions of dollars for cartels that are furthering the distribution of fentanyl into the US. It is a move, under the Trump administration's new fentanyl sanctions authority, that officials say will block certain money transfers between the sanctioned banks and US banks. The banks, CIBanco and Intercam Banco, as well as brokerage Vector Casa de Bolsa, ""have collectively played a longstanding and vital role in laundering millions of dollars on behalf of Mexico-based cartels"" US deputy Treasury secretary Michael Faulkender told reporters on Wednesday, local time. He added the financial institutions were ""facilitating payments for the procurement of precursor chemicals needed to produce fentanyl"" and would now be  ""effectively cut off"" from doing business with US financial institutions. While the sanctions do not block property or cut off all global US dollar-based activities, as other Treasury sanctions have, they do prohibit US transactions with their locations in Mexico, a US Treasury official noted. Although US sanctions against individuals and companies for links to Mexican organised crime groups are fairly frequent, measures against financial institutions are far less common. The Mexican Finance Ministry said in a statement it was notified of the investigation and asked the US Treasury for evidence of illicit activity links to CIBanco, Intercam and Vector, but it received no ""conclusive information"". Vector categorically rejected ""any accusation that compromises its institutional integrity"", it said in a statement. It added that it reiterated its full willingness to collaborate with Mexican and US authorities to clarify the situation. Intercam similarly ""categorically"" denied ""any connection between this institution and any illicit practice"". CIBanco did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Experts said the move, although targeting relatively small institutions, could have significant impact on Mexico's financial system given the interconnectedness with the United States. Luis Manuel Perez de Acha, a tax lawyer and money laundering expert in Mexico City, said the accusations were a ""bombshell"". ""The entire financial system passes through the United States, so they are practically left without operations,"" he said. Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a specialist on organised crime, said the sanctions were ""enormously impactful"". ""This is a bold move. Being cut off from the US financial system is a death blow,"" she told Reuters. ""These are hardly the biggest banks in Mexico, but they are not small entities."" ""These are medium-level banks,"" Ms Felbab-Brown said. However, she said the sanctions were unlikely to ""make any kind of dent in the financial flows of Mexican criminal groups"". According to the Treasury orders, CIBanco helped facilitate money laundering for a number of cartels, including the Jalisco New Generation, Beltran Leyva and Gulf. Officials said the bank ""facilitated procurement"" of chemicals used to make fentanyl from China by processing over $US2.1 million in payments for the materials. Vector was accused of facilitating money laundering for the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels, including $US1 million in payments for fentanyl chemicals. The Treasury officials also said the Sinaloa Cartel used Vector to send bribes to former Mexican security secretary Genaro García Luna, who in October was sentenced to more than 38 years in prison by a New York court for the charges. They estimated that transactions exceeded $US40 million. The Trump administration has announced it is cracking down on Mexican cartels and fentanyl trafficking despite movement of the drug along the US border and overdoses within the country declining.

"Australia should dominate supply of green shipping fuel, says Rod Sims",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/australia-should-dominate-supply-green-shipping-fuels-rod-sims/105457500,2025-06-25,"Australia has a timely opportunity to become the world's dominant provider of green shipping fuel, says Superpower Institute chair Rod Sims. If Australia secured 25 per cent of the green shipping fuel trade, it would generate $43 billion in export revenue and help our country become a major exporter of green energy-intensive products, he said. But we will ""fail comprehensively"" if progress is simply left to industry or consumers, he said, so the government will have to pave the way by acting in at least three policy areas. He said Australia could also capitalise on the Trump administration's anti-climate policies, because many investors who were planning to invest in green production in the US were now looking for a new home for their projects. ""There is considerable expectation of this occurring on many fronts,"" he said. ""Australia is well placed to benefit. ""If the world economy and climate are to function effectively, the US must be ignored as much as possible, and like-minded countries need to move forward collectively. ""There is so much at stake,"" he said. Mr Sims made his comments on Wednesdayin a speechat Maritime Industry Australia's 5th Maritime Decarbonisation Summit in Melbourne. Mr Sims said recent regulatory developments in the maritime sector were playing into Australia's hands. He said that in April, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) approved itsdraft net-zero regulations for the international shipping sector. The new regulatory framework covers ocean-going vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage, which account for approximately 85 per cent of international shipping emissions. The draft framework will need to be formally adopted in October, and then it will come into force in 2027. Mr Sims said that when it comes into force, it will create an effective ""world carbon price for shipping fuel."" And that will provide Australia with an opportunity. ""The IMO net-zero framework is the first in the world to combine mandatory emissions limits and carbon pricing across an entire industry sector,"" he said. ""This represents the first global sectoral price on carbon, an amazing milestone of which the shipping industry should feel proud. ""This framework combines mandatory emissions limits and greenhouse gas pricing, establishing what will be a legally binding framework. ""The global fuel standard stipulates ships must reduce, over time, their annual greenhouse gas fuel intensity calculated using a well-to-wake approach,"" he said. Mr Sims said the US withdrew in April from the IMO arrangements, with the US delegation walking out of the meeting. ""The US may eventually come on board, but the world cannot wait for this to happen,"" he said. He said Australia had to capitalise on this broader opportunity. ""One of the first places to start on Australia's journey of being a major exporter of green energy-intensive exports is in producing green shipping fuel,"" he said. ""With our advantages in producing green energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable biomass, Australia is in a superb position to dominate the production of green shipping fuel. ""In November 2024, the Superpower Institute (TSI) released itsNew Energy Tradereport, which, among many other things, identified that the component of shipping which could be decarbonised using green fuels accounts for 1.8 per cent of global emissions. ""If Australia's market share of the green shipping fuel trade was 25 per cent, this would result in a mitigation contribution of 0.4 per cent of global emissions with an export revenue potential of around $43 billion,"" he said. Mr Sims said the government had to help clear the way. He said Australia had to greatly reduce the time for project approvals or rejections, which currently makes Australia an unattractive place to invest. He also linked the idea of becoming a major exporter of green shipping fuel with Australia's plans to become a clean energy superpower more generally. He said with the IMO's effective carbon price for shipping, and the government's$2kg hydrogen production credit, some key pieces of the puzzle had fallen into place for Australia's ambition to become a renewable energy superpower. He said those things were necessary for Australia to develop a globally competitive ""green iron"" industry, and the government should seize the opportunity to help it get off the ground. ""The IMO, in providing an effective world carbon price for shipping fuel, is providing Australia an opportunity,"" he said. ""The question is whether we will grasp it now. ""Do so, and we boost Australia’s economy and productivity, and provide a hedge against declining exports of fossil fuels. Do so, and the world benefits from one of the cheapest sources of green fuels. ""What will our government now do? ""Hopefully, it will put in place grants for innovation from early projects, assist with infrastructure, and deal with our system of embarrassingly slow project approval."""
Inflation eases back more than expected in May,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/inflation-abs-monthly-consumer-price-index-may/105458134,2025-06-25,"Inflation eased further last month, with consumer prices rising 2.1 per cent over the year to May, down from 2.4 per cent the previous month. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) was at its lowest level since October 2024. The annual trimmed mean, a measure of underlying inflation, was down to 2.4 per cent in May, from 2.8 per cent in April, which the ABS said was its lowest rate since November 2021. Ahead of the data release, market pricing put the chance of an interest rate cut in July around 81 per cent, according to LSEG. Following the weaker-than-expected figures, pricing rose to an 88 per cent chance. The Reserve Bank next meets to consider interest rates in just under a fortnight's time. ""Underlying inflation sits comfortably within the RBA's target, allowing the RBA to cut rates again with confidence that inflation is under control,"" economist Callam Pickering, from job site Indeed, said. He noted that ""even a less favourable set"" of inflation figures might have been overlooked by the RBA and not been a barrier to a rate cut, given the concerns about the global economic outlook. Mr Pickering has forecast a 0.25 percentage point cut on July 8, followed by another move lower in either August or September. Commonwealth Bank economists were among those shifting their rate cut forecasts forward in the wake of the CPI data. ""We now expect the RBA to cut the cash rate in July and August this year (from August and September),"" CBA economist Harry Ottley wrote, describing inflation as remaining ""benign"" in the second quarter. ""There is a clear risk of a further cut late this year or early next."" Deutsche Bank chief economist Phil O'Donaghoe also changed his call to July, along with further cuts in August and November. While food and non-alcoholic beverages were the biggest contributor to the headline CPI, they rose 2.9 per cent over the year — down from 3.1 per cent in April. Fruit and vegetables rose 2.8 per cent in the year to May, down significantly from the 6.1 per cent increase recorded a month earlier. Looking at fruit in isolation, prices actually fell last month, down 2.7 per cent, with lower prices for mandarins, oranges, avocados and apples. Meanwhile, electricity rebates continued to impact energy costs, with electricity prices down 5.9 per cent over the 12 months to May — that was a smaller fall than the 6.5 per cent in April. ""In Victoria, the impact of these rebates was lower in May than April due to the timing of payments,"" ABS head of prices statistics Michelle Marquardt noted. Beatshares chief economist David Bassanese noted that the monthly CPI readings could be more volatile than the quarterly data. The next quarterly CPI is due in late July, after the next RBA board meeting. ""The low trimmed mean result keeps the door open for a potential RBA rate cut in July, but my base case is the [Reserve] Bank will still wait until August — following confirmation of low underlying inflation in the more comprehensive and reliable quarterly CPI report in late July,"" he wrote. However, Mr Bassanese warned that any easing in affordability for first home buyers would likely be short-lived because he expected lower mortgage rates to filter through to higher house prices. Annual housing inflation eased back to 2 per cent in May, down from 2.2 per cent in April. Rents rose 4.5 per cent over the year, down from 5 per cent a month earlier. ""This is the lowest annual growth in rental prices since December 2022, consistent with smaller increases in advertised rents and stable vacancy rates across most capital cities,"" the ABS noted. New dwelling price rises also cooled to the smallest annual growth since April 2021, which the ABS attributed to ""project home builders offer[ing] discounts and promotional offers to entice business."""
Strain of interest rates hitting home loan borrowers but relief in sight,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/mortgage-arrears-rise-from-record-low-but-experts-arent-worried/105453714,2025-06-25,"The number of Australians falling behind on mortgage payments is on the rise, but experts say it is nothing to be alarmed about, as it comes off record-low levels. Credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings found the number of home owners who were more than 30 days late on repaying their loans rose by 23 basis points in the first three months of the year, up to 1.35 per cent. Arrears among borrowers with non-conforming mortgages (often those with a lower credit rating) rose to 5.32 per cent. Fitch said while arrears rates usually rose at the start of the year due to post-holiday financial pressure, this jump was almost three times the historical average. That was likely due to ""the cumulative strain of prolonged higher interest rates on households and persistent inflation stretching household budgets"", it said. However, property research firm Cotality (formerly CoreLogic) described arrears as remaining ""constrained"", despite the pressure from rates and the cost of living. According to Cotality, the string of rate rises over the past few years meant a borrower with a $750,000 mortgage saw monthly repayments rise by about $1,550 between the low point and high point of the rates cycle. Cotality's research director, Tim Lawless, noted most borrowers were keeping on top of mortgage repayments, and the small rise in arrears from record lows was not concerning. The research firm's report cited different data, from the prudential regulator APRA, that showed the portion of borrowers overdue or impaired on their repayments increased to 1.68 per cent in the first quarter, though well below pandemic-era peaks and international benchmarks. Fitch noted that this year's interest rate cuts, delivered by the Reserve Bank after the first quarter data was gathered, as well as a predicted further rate cut this year, should help home owners weather the storm and keep a lid on any further rise in arrears. Mr Lawless attributed the lower-than-expected rise in arrears to tighter lending buffers, less risky loans being issued, as well as strong employment rates despite the pressures of elevated interest rates and higher costs of living. ""Lending standards have been unquestionably strong throughout the recent cycle, with a consistently low portion of mortgage originations considered 'risky',"" Mr Lawless said. Mr Lawless said interest-only loans made up less than 20 per cent of lending in the first quarter, and that high loan-to-income and high debt-to-income lending was well below pre-rate hike levels, at 3.1 per cent and 5.8 per cent of loans respectively. Cotality also attributed the low arrears rate tothe mortgage serviceability buffer, a rate set by APRA that assesses prospective borrowers' ability to repay a mortgage at three percentage points above the current mortgage rate. ""Lifting the buffer from 2.5 percentage points to 3.0 percentage points in October 2021 has helped to lower the default risk, even though mortgage rates have risen a lot more than three percentage points from their 2022 lows,"" Mr Lawless said. He also noted that ""although interest rates are now falling and expected to reduce further, there has been no sign from APRA that the serviceability buffer will be lowered"". A further reason for low arrears is a strong labour market, allowing people to keep paying a mortgage even when repayments rise. May's unemployment rate was 4.1 per cent,and underemployment, which measures workers who want to work more hours, has also remained low. Cotality also noted that high household savings during the pandemic and an anecdotal tightening of household budgets may be helping mortgage borrowers stay afloat amid cost-of-living pressures. The household saving ratio held above 10 per cent between mid-2020 and early 2022, Cotality reports. After contracting in the last quarter of 2024 and then growing in the first quarter of 2025, Fitch Ratings predicted home prices to continue rising in 2025 thanks to limited housing supply, falling interest rates, and high net migration in the previous two years. The median house price in Sydney is forecast to jump by another 7 per cent in 2025-26, to $1.83 million by June 2026, according to Domain's latest Price Forecast Report. It means the typical house price in Sydney will rise by $112,000, which is more than the average full-time worker earns before tax ($103,000). The next decision on interest rates will be made by the Reserve Bank's monetary policy board on July 8. Financial markets are pricing an 80 per cent chance of an interest rate cut at that meeting."
Spirit of Tasmania V officially handed over to ferry operator TT-Line,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/tas-spirit-of-tasmania-v-officially-handed-over/105462100,2025-06-26,"The second of the two new Spirit of Tasmania ships has been handed over to TT-Line by Finnish ship-building company Rauma Marine Constructions (RMC). Spirit of Tasmania V was officially accepted by one of the Tasmanian ferry operator's directors, retired Rear Admiral Steve Gilmore, on Wednesday evening. TT-Line chief executive Chris Carbone said it marked ""a significant milestone in our journey"". A TT-Line spokespersondid not say when Spirit V was expected to set sail for Tasmania, or whether any further works or sea trials needed to be completed before it did. On Sunday, Tasmanian Premier Jeremy Rockliff said the other new ferry, Spirit of Tasmania IV,would arrive in Australia from Scotland in August. It follows a lengthy infrastructure debacle, when it emerged last year that TT-Line had failed to build a berth for the vessels in Devonport on time. It is not expected to be completed until at least October 2026. Spirit of Tasmania IV was then moved to a port in Scotland while the Liberal state government explored options to lease it out. It was expected to leave for Australia in May, but an issue was detected with its liquid natural gas system. RMC has since managed to modify the system, and the ship has been undertaking sea trials. Late last week, Mr Rockliff said Spirit IV's journey back to Australia would take about 10 weeks. The ship will head to Hobart where it will receive final fit-outs. TT-Line said as of late April, storing the vessel in Scotland had cost the Tasmanian government $4.3 million, including fuel, crew and port costs. The Spirit of Tasmania saga was one of three reasons listed on Labor's successful no-confidence motion against Mr Rockliff, which has led to the calling of a state election. During the election campaign, Labor has drawn attention to the many issues with the project and promised that both ships would be home before Christmas. On Sunday, Labor leader Dean Winter also said he would make sure the new ferries could refuel with locally produced LNG at their home port. ""Refuelling with LNG is good for the environment, it's better for Devonport, it's better for passengers,"" he said."
Same old saviours rescue Aussies after 'woeful' top-order batting,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/sport-west-indies-vs-australia-first-test-day-one-analysis/105461652,2025-06-26,"There had been a lot of change in Australia's batting line up coming into this Test. There was a suggestion that this was the start of Australia's new batting era. With Steve Smith injured, Marnus Labuschagne dropped and Australia stinging after a South African ambush in north west London, now was the time to chance one's arm. And with these three Tests the only trials before the Ashes, it really is now or never. With Sam Konstas and Josh Inglis thrown into the side together, there was a feeling that this was the start of the much-needed renewal of this Australian top order. But as much as things change, they remain the same and, after a horror first hour that saw the Aussies reduced to 3-22 in the 16th over, it took two settled veterans to rescue the Australian blushes. That opening hour was, in short, a complete disaster for Australia. Konstas was out for three. Green was out for three — having already been dropped on zero. Inglis was out for five. Had Windies debutant Brandon King not suffered a case of the butter fingers at gully, Khawaja would had been added to that list for a total of just six as well — a dismissal that would have added to a trend of low scores for Australia's only stable column at the top of the order. It was a desperately nervous start, the batters twitchy and uncertain on a deck that offered plenty of movement. Those nerves may be understandable — but none of the problems are new. Much in the way that Australia was struggling to reorder its batters the last time these two sides met in a Test series in 2024 following the retirement of David Warner, the Aussies were still in almost exactly the same place, none the wiser as to who should sit at the top of the order. Since Warner's retirement the opening partners have come and gone for Khawaja — Smith, Labuschagne, Travis Head, Konstas and Nathan McSweeney — all taking their turns, a confused conveyor of curious options, none of which ever quite fitted. Making a snap judgement of the prospects of this line up off the basis of one innings on a tough pitch away from home is absurd. On flatter Australian pitches this line up would likely excel. But even a two-paced pitch could not excuse some of the woeful top-order batting on display from some of Australia's new guard. The hype around Konstas over the past 12 months meant that his return to the side to partner Khawaja was given a similar vibe to the Special Ks from the tennis world, but in its first iteration this series they ended up looking just as flaky as the breakfast cereal. Konstas looked cagey, lasting just 14 nervous deliveries where he barely middled a single ball before being trapped LBW by the brilliant Shamar Joseph — albeit by a superb, seaming delivery of the type that openers are liable to be faced with. Proponents of the 19-year-old's premature promotion to the Test side — this is just his 31st first-class innings from 17 matches and only his third Test match — will say his development into a free-hitting David Warner-esque opener needs challenges like this. And they are right. There is enough development to come from Konstas that making sweeping, grandiose statements based on a single innings in unfamiliar conditions in Bridgetown would be to assume every game he plays will be like that Boxing Day blast with which he flustered Jasprit Bumrah six months ago is his default, and unless he reverse sweeps every ball he faces, every innings is a failure. Joseph was exceptional throughout the day, bowling to a plan and hitting a testing length to everyone, Australia's Gabba golem back to torment the Australian batters once again. His delivery to bowl Beau Webster for 11 before tea was just about unplayable, deviating away and clipping the top of the off bail. He should have had a second wicket in the same over he dismissed Konstas, finding the edge of Green's bat only to see debutant Brandon King shell a simple chance at gully. Joseph tormented Green, beating his edge repeatedly, the West Australian guilty of playing way outside his body with the hard hands that cost him against South Africa at Lord's. Despite seeing Khawaja dropped by his skipper at first slip during that spell, Joseph didn't let his head drop, finding the edge of Green's bat again to end his erratic stay, Justin Greaves taking a brilliant low catch at second slip. The manner of the Australians' dismissals should give rise to some concerns about their suitability of batting at the top of the order against anything close to resembling a moving ball. On a pitch that was clearly not as placid as had been advertised, all of Australia's top three were guilty of playing a long way from their bodies, inviting the edges that eventually cost Konstas and Green their wickets. Konstas was trapped on the crease, non-existent footwork again his weakness, while Green was too desperate to get bat on ball, pushing his hands way outside the line and paid the price as a result. Inglis had looked relatively comfortable while he was at the crease but a lack of patience saw him swing wildly at a short delivery that he skied, Shai Hope taking a simple catch. Australia hadn't scored a single boundary inside the opening 15 overs, trapped inside a cage of doubt built by a muddled selection strategy and reinforced by the failures of the top order. As is so often the case, it took Travis Head to come in and change the narrative with yet another magnificent 53. As is his wont, Head dropped to one knee and slapped a wide delivery through the covers with a conviction that had been entirely lacking from the Aussie batters before him for his first runs off just the fifth delivery he faced. That, the first boundary of the innings, came off the 96th ball of the match. Head's masterful application of controlled aggression, cutting and scything anything wide of the stumps seemed to offer the necessary reset to Khawaja, who launched Alzarri Joseph over square leg for a massive six just three balls after Australia broke its boundary duck. In all, Australia scored five boundaries in the next 16 balls, the shackles finally released by the old stagers. Khawaja was far from his vintage best, his cagey footwork and instability in the shot lending itself to some muddled decisions and a host of false shots he was fortunate did not result in him losing his wicket long before he eventually departed for 47 — especially as he was dropped on 45. His 128-ball stay was exactly what Australia needed, but you'd be hard pushed to say it was all plain sailing, and reflects an increasingly worrying trend. The 38-year-old has scored just two centuries in his last 42 innings — although to be fair one of those was a massive double in Galle earlier this year. The progression is only trending one way now, sadly. Head though, was exceptional. Again. Last time he played the West Indies he got a king pair for the first and only time in his Test career, the start of a rare slump when he scored just 80 runs in seven innings. There was a degree of luck in his extended stay, the South Australian surviving a fearsome barrage from Shamar Joseph shortly before tea and only avoiding being given out for 53 by a charitable decision by third umpire Adrian Holdstock. It was a good job that Head's luck held though, because outside him it was slim pickings from a batting perspective."
"How Australian Rules football adapts to the weather, and who's best in the wet",https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/the-winter-game-how-australian-rules-football-adapts-to-weather/105462202,2025-06-26,"Football is a game for all seasons. The ball is first bounced for the year in the waning hours of summer, with play continuing through autumn, winter and spring. The conditions of any two (non-indoor) football games are rarely the same. Football is played at all hours of the day across all corners of the country. It's not just rain, hail or shine — it's also blustery gales and sunny days, steamy nights and even snow. Preparing to beat the conditions along with opponents has been an obsession for footballers for generations. Over time, different game styles have emerged to conquer the elements, whatever they are. Players, teams and businesses have also attempted technological solutions — from sticky substances to more stable boots, waterproof footies to ice vests — to try to get an edge. At the same time, football is spanning across more of the year than ever before. That means an extra element — high heat — is getting more common in footy games. Different teams tend to excel in different conditions, leading to wild swings depending on the weather. So, how does football change depending on the season? And what teams do better in different conditions? In its development as a sport, Australian Football was designed as a winter game, a counterpart to the summer pursuit of cricket. For most of the game's history, footy took the grounds when it was too wet or cold to play cricket. In its suburban past (and grassroots present), mud, sweat and tears were common elements of football. Although the grounds have improved over time, rain still affects play. Teams still need to consider how to approach the game when the ground becomes slippery or sodden. Wet-weather footy has its own lexicon, separate and different from how the game is played in the dry. Then-Richmond VFL coach and current Collingwood coach Craig McRae broke down the basics of wet-weather football in 2017 when talking to Richmond great Matthew Richardson. ABC Sport is live blogging every round of theAFLandNRLseasons in 2025. ""[It's about] just doing the fundamentals right, not trying to overuse it — which we do sometimes,"" McRae explained. ""It's a subtle change. We're playing a lot of contested footy, kicking long down the line … it sort of plays into wet-weather conditions well."" ""We want to get territory … Even just punching the ball off the ground — just keep the ball going forward. Sometimes it doesn't look pretty."" McRae might be one of the best judges of how to play in the wet. Since 2022, no side has been better in wet weather conditions than the Pies. Not every team plays the same amount of time in the wet. Docklands home teams have less chance to experience such conditions. Perth tends to be sunnier and drier. Sydney teams and outdoor Victorian teams can spend nearly one in six games dealing with the rain. That means that getting to know how to play in the wet can be tougher for some teams. Tackles, pressure and turnovers go up when the rain falls, and scoring shots diminish. There are more contested possessions across the ground and less ball in space. Marks go down generally but stoppages jump a ton. Defenders also have an easier time winning their one-on-one contests and spoils tend to spike. If you win the contested possession battle in the dry, you win about 64 per cent of the time. In the wet, it jumps to 69 per cent. There's an even larger increase for teams that win forward 50 ground ball gets (61 per cent to 72 per cent). If all this sounds like a bit of a throwback, then you are probably right. Wet-weather footy now tends to resemble footy — wet or dry — of the past. In the wet, the game tends to be played more in a straight line, with the field stretched out. Teams use the corridor significantly less (around 20 per cent less) when transitioning from defence in the wet, and are often reluctant to switch. Width is used less and positions are adhered to more. Even with the improvements to boots, grounds and the football itself, the first principles of footy — ground position and possession — come to the fore. In short, it's a bit like 80s footy. Staying in front of the ball — and your opponent — is critical. ""It's one of the things you learn as a kid coming through, you don't let the ball over the back in wet conditions,"" Sydney coach John Longmire stated in 2014. Longmire's Swans played in one of the wettest games in recent memory just two years later when over 250mm of rain hit the Gold Coast before and during their game against the Suns. There's also a significant increase in the amount of contested knock-ons and ground kicks in the wet — almost a quarter more, this year. That ability to gain territory at all costs is still the main fundamental for teams when rain strikes. There's some school of thought that teams may be a little too conservative when adapting to the wet these days. Brisbane, for example, was slick in handling the ball in slippery conditions at Kardinia Park last week. The Lions were willing to stretch the ground and switch the ball where possible. ""It was quite slippery out there. It looked slippery for us — didn't look as slippery for them,"" quipped Geelong coach Chris Scott to ABC Sport after their loss last week. But the wet isn't the only type of weather footy players have to deal with. While wet weather takes much of the attention, other weather conditions can significantly impact how football is played. Take that Geelong-Brisbane match that Scott was talking about last week. That game was played in slippery conditions — but it didn't rain before or during the game. Instead, it was a combination of cold and humid conditions that created dew on the field and ball. Moisture — whether dew, frost or general greasiness — tends to occur when the relative humidity starts to approach 100 per cent. As the air saturates with moisture, the game starts to look soggy — similar to a wet-weather game. Contested ball becomes more important, and it becomes significantly harder to mark the ball. ""It wasn't a pretty game of footy but it's not a 'pretty game of footy weekend'. It was pretty slippery all over the place this weekend,"" Port coach Ken Hinkley explained to ABC Sport after their win over GWS in Canberra earlier this month. ""Of course you have to adjust to what you play [to] what the conditions are so, you know, it's something we had to do."" That game was also quite cold, peaking at just 6 degrees. Surprisingly that's not the coldest game this year — with the Adelaide-Hawthorn match-up at Launceston dropping slightly closer to freezing. Both games were low-scoring slogs. Cold-weather footy is often accompanied by rain or dew. Even when it's dry, it's unpleasant. It's something that the league doesn't experience too often, but the introduction of the Tassie Devils might see it become more commonplace. Cold-weather footy sees some impacts to scoring and ball movement but not much difference in contest around the ball, unlike wet weather. Tasmania — and Hobart in particular — often also sees blustery conditions and howling winds. That also can significantly affect the way the game is played. Windy games see far fewer marks taken but more territory gained in total. There are also more turnovers, and targets are harder to hit by hand or foot. Unsurprisingly, Fremantle with their famous ""doctor"" play in gusty winds the most. More surprisingly, Essendon doesn't play in the wind much — showing their distance from their Windy Hill days. The introduction of Tassie will also exacerbate something alluded to above: the length of the season. The ever-increasing length of the season has seen an increase of games in warm and very hot conditions. The first four rounds of the season saw the AFL Heat Policy enacted each week, with extended quarter-time breaks and additional water carriers permitted. That's something the AFLW has had to deal with as it has expanded and something that players in that competition have struggled with. Hot-weather games tend to see faster, freer-flowing football with more uncontested marks and bounces than in colder conditions. There's more uncontested ball and fewer stoppages. Ball retention becomes easier in general. But there are also other real risks to playing in heat. After his team played a midday game against West Coast in the blazing sun, Brisbane coach Chris Fagan was blunt about how it negatively affected the players. ""They were pretty cooked, and you could tell just walking out onto the ground after — probably a record number of cramps, I don't know."" Fagan mused. ""I haven't seen that many of our blokes struggle like that [before]."" Regardless of the heat, cold, rain, wind or even snow, footy can change at the drop of a weather forecast — and your team might just be the one to capitalise."
Aussie Joint topples British star in pre-Wimbledon upset victory,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/maya-joint-emma-raducanu-eastbourne-international-wimbledon/105461910,2025-06-26,"Australia's Maya Joint has defeated former US Open champion Emma Raducanu at the pre-Wimbledon Eastbourne International. Joint's 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7/4) win booked a quarterfinal berth on the same day six of her compatriots reached the final round of Wimbledon qualifying. The 19-year-old is already in the women's main draw at Wimbledon but could be joined by world number 209 Emerson Jones. Jones must beat France's Diane Parry in the final round of Wimbledon qualifying to become the youngest Australian to make the women's main draw since Ash Barty in 2012. After losing the first set to 38th-ranked Raducanu, Joint dominated her opponent, winning 11 of the next 14 games to move into a 5-2 lead in the deciding set. Raducanu, the 2021 US Open winner, fought back, breaking Joint three times. But Joint held her nerve to force a tiebreak, before delivering a fantastic off-balance backhand to earn match point at 6-4. She served her third ace of the match for one of the best wins in a burgeoning career that has seen her jump from 1,384 in the world 18 months ago to her current ranking of 51. Joint will move inside the top 50 if she can beat Russian world number 69 Anna Blinkova in the quarterfinals. ""Today was really tough, there was a lot of up and downs, lot of momentum switches, but I'm really glad that I was able to tough it out in the end,"" said Joint, who had lost to Raducanu on clay at the Italian Open. ""I'm really glad I was able to win this one. I definitely try to hit the lines. Doesn't always work, so I'm glad it worked today. ""But I think I'm an aggressive player, I like to use my backhand and am trying to learn how to play all-court."" Meanwhile at Roehampton, 16-year-old Jones, Talia Gibson, Priscilla Hon, Alex Bolt, Li Tu and James McCabe all booked places in the final round of qualifying for Wimbledon. Jones is on the verge of her first main-draw appearance at a major outside Australia after beating Serbian Lola Radivojević 6-4, 6-4. There is the prospect of 19 Australians earning spots in the singles draws for Wimbledon, which begins on Monday. AAP"
Matildas midfielder ruled out of Montemurro's debut against Slovenia,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/matildas-clare-wheeler-joe-montemurro-slovenia/105462040,2025-06-26,"Everton midfielder Clare Wheeler has become the latest Matildas squad member to be ruled out of the current international window ahead of Joe Montemurro's debut as head coach. Wheeler arrived in Perth earlier this week but on Wednesday withdrew from the squad due to personal reasons. ABC Sport will be live blogging the Matildas' friendly against Slovenia on Thursday evening. Chloe Berryhill and Jessika Nash have since been added to the Matildas squad. Striker Sam Kerr is in camp but still recovering from the ACL rupture she suffered more than 17 months ago. Mary Fowler (knee) and Tameka Yallop (leg) are also out injured, while Steph Catley, Caitlin Foord, Katrina Gorry and Cortnee Vine are all on personal leave. Montemurro will get his first taste of life in the Matildas hot seat when he takes the reins for Thursday night's friendly with Slovenia in Perth. The teams will lock horns again on Sunday, before the Matildas face Panama in Bunbury on July 5 and in Perth on July 8. The four matches mark an important building block for Montemurro as he attempts to bed down a new game plan ahead of next year's Asian Cup in Australia, which begins on March 1. Montemurro enjoyed successful coaching stints at Arsenal, Juventus and Lyon. He wants to implement an attacking, possession-based style at the Matildas, who have slipped to 15th on the world rankings. ""It's the official start of our build-up for the Asian Cup,"" Montemurro said on Wednesday. ""Yes, I am looking at a lot of players. Yes, I am trying to instil some language. Yes, I am trying to instil some new ideas. ""But the approach to the game is still the same … it's a game that we want to win."" Defender Ellie Carpenter played under Montemurro at Lyon and was thrilled when he landed the top job at the Matildas. ""I think we're going to really thrive under Joe,"" Carpenter said. ""You can see already, by day three we've implemented a new style of play, a new rhythm. ""Joe's really experienced internationally. He's coached at the biggest clubs and I think the most important thing that he's implemented so far is possession-based football. ""I think we're very capable of doing that."" AAP"
What you can do to stop the spread of illness in your home,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-26/limit-spread-viruses-sickness-covid-at-home/105455676,2025-06-26,"Winter can be a contagious time of year for everything from COVID-19 to the common cold. Once someone in your household feels the first ominous tickle at the back of their throat, everyone else can feel doomed to follow. ""It's always a challenge within households because we know households are the place where viruses like respiratory viruses spread really efficiently,"" says Catherine Bennett, Deakin University's chair of epidemiology. But there are ways to limit the risk of illnesses spreading from one family member or housemate to another, she says. Professor Bennett says if someone within your household becomes sick,it is possible you have already been exposedbefore they had any symptoms. However,if the sick person can isolate from the rest of household it's still worth it, she says.Ideally this would look like using a separate bedroom and bathroom to others. She says this degree of isolation is not possible or realistic for many households. Isolation can also look like someone sleeping on the couchto ""reduce their risk of inhaling the virus"" from their unwell partner overnight, she says. Medical director for government-funded online public health information service Healthdirect Darran Foo says if possible, the symptomatic person should remain isolated from the rest of the household until they no longer have active symptoms. For example, ""no more ongoing fevers, no more coughing up lots of phlegm"". If someone in the household is symptomatic, and isolating completely is not possible, Professor Bennett saysa mask can help protect the rest of the household. ""Wearing a mask if you're unwell can reduce your risk of passing it on to other people."" Dr Foo also advises wearing a mask if it's possible and practical,particularly if you live in a smaller homelike an apartment. Dr Foo recommendsthrowing used tissues away immediatelyandavoiding sharing cups, plates and cutleryin the household when someone is unwell, whether from a cold or COVID-19. ""The biggest thing really is to maintain good hygiene, especially good hand hygiene,"" Dr Foo says. ""Lots of hand washing and using sanitisers as much as possible."" Professor Benett also says you should ""wash your own hands more often in between touching things, even around the home"" when you or someone else is sick. She recommends wiping down commonly used surfaces — such as the bathroom — more often. Any surfaces where someone has coughed may have droplets over them, she says. Professor Bennett says ""bugs do so well [in winter because] we can't air our houses out"". Poor ventilation will make it easier for viruses to spread, but she says increasing air turnover and introducing outdoor air can help. Open doors and windows when you can""so it's not the same air pushing right through the household that's around the person who's unwell."" Dr Foo also says the more ventilation you can get at home the better, while of course avoiding hypothermia. Dr Foo says ""the general advice all remains the same"" if someone in the household is potentially more vulnerable. However, he says people more at risk of becoming seriously unwellmay want to consult their regular healthcare professionalwho knows their medical history. ""It really depends on that person's risk, their comorbidities and what ongoing conditions they have — and also to identify whether it's appropriate to use antiviral medication at that point in time."" Professor Bennett says being diligent with mask wearing, hand washing and sanitising surfaces is particularly worth doing if someone in the house is vulnerable. Professor Bennett says being up to date with COVID-19 and influenza vaccinations will offer another layer of protection. ""If you can't avoid infection in the household — and that's the hardest place to do it — then actually having some protection from severe illness is really important in influenza."" In larger shared households there are more people to bring viruses home and that extra protection from vaccination is even more important, ""particularly from severe illness in the vulnerable people in our households"", Professor Bennett says. Dr Foo also encouragespeople to stay up to date with their vaccinations, ""especially their annual flu vaccination and their COVID booster shots"". This is general information only. For personal advice, you should see a qualified medical practitioner."

That's according to fertility reproductive counsellor Narelle Dickinson, who says there is anxiety for past IVF users about whether they may have been exposed to lab errors, and also for prospective and current patients. ""IVF is stressful anyway. This is a really, really distressing set of events that has occurred,"" says Ms Dickinson, based in Brisbane/Meanjin. She says with any medical procedure or treatment, people need to have ""a lot of faith and confidence"" in their treating team. And while that may feel harder in the wake of the embryo mix-ups, there are ways patients undergoing fertility treatments can feel more in control. Manuela Toledo is a board member with the Fertility Society of Australia and New Zealand, medical director at TasIVF and a fertility specialist at Melbourne IVF. She says many of her patients come in with a list of questions, which she encourages. ""Most patients are very well informed … and they understand that the IVF clinics, including the doctors, the nurses, the embryologists, the medical scientists … put our best foot forward and try our hardest every day. ""At the same time, we recognise there is a level of concern out there at the moment. And one way [for providers] to address that is by providing information about processes and what to expect when they come to clinic."" She says one of the most important first questions for people to ask their clinic is ""Can you tell us why we have infertility?"" Even though one-third of infertility cases remain unexplained after thorough testing, Dr Toledo explains that asking this question ensures patients understand the investigative processes. ""It's very important to understand 'Why am I having this treatment?' and 'What treatment am I going to have?' and 'What is the likely outcome going to be for me?',"" Dr Toledo says. Ms Dickinson says it's also reasonable for a patient to ask things like ""Who is in the laboratory? Can I meet the staff who are taking care of me?"" If you need help brainstorming a list of questions, especially around the processes or science, Ms Dickinson recommends patients visitYourIVFSuccess, an independent resource funded by the Australian Government. ""It provides some good, high-level information and can be helpful to work out what you might need to know to ask your doctors questions."" Dr Toledo also recommends theFertility Society of Australia and New Zealandwebsite. Patients should always feel they are in the driver's seat of their treatment, says Ms Dickinson. ""If they ever feel their questions are being dismissed or brushed off, that is a problem. ""They have every right to know what is happening in terms of the laboratory, the medications they are being prescribed, in terms of any treatment protocols."" Karin Hammarberg is an adjunct senior research fellow at Monash University and former IVF nurse. She says people ""should not give up [asking]"" until they have the answers they need. ""The clinics will expect that more people will ask questions now. This has become a trust problem,"" she says. ""Sometimes you have to be pushy and difficult."" Dr Toledo says if you are still feeling unsure, seek a second opinion from a fertility specialist. There are other things patients can look out for at clinics when considering or undergoing fertility treatment. ""One thing you will notice when you walk into an IVF clinic, there is always a so-called three-point ID check,"" Dr Toledo says. ""[You are] asked your name, date of birth and address."" She says that is something that should be done ""every step of the way"". While informed consent processes will vary clinic to clinic, Dr Toledo says a good example is one that includes verbal, written, and visual consenting, such as a ""mini movie"" showing the process of IVF. ""A lot of individuals are very visual, it's nice to see the information not just in verbal and written form, which is especially important to patients where English may not be their first language."" When it comes to consent forms, Dr Hammarberg says people should take the time to read them thoroughly before signing. ""It's not always in the most accessible language … [but] take it home and have a read. If you have questions, ask them."" Another green flag is staff capacity and wellbeing, says Ms Dickinson. She recently co-authored a paper examiningburnout in IVF nurses, and says it was clear that like any business, fertility clinics are susceptible to the impact of reduced staffing levels, or low staff wellbeing. ""When too much pressure is placed on employees, when they are tired, when they are stressed, when they're in distress, they are at risk of burnout. ""Unfortunately, these same factors increase the risk of human error in all areas of the fertility clinic."" Ms Dickinson says while you are ""not necessarily going to ask if staffing levels are at accreditation standards"", you might be able to tell if there are staff ""who are not OK, or there just doesn't seem to be enough people to get the work done"". Fertility counsellors connected to clinics or working independently will be able to assist people to work through any anxieties they have, Ms Dickinson says. ""They are there to provide emotional support during treatment, but they can also be a good place to unpack any worries or concerns you might have."" They can also help form questions you might need to ask clinicians, she says, often having ""a bit more time"" to sit down and unpack things with you. Dr Toledo says patients should remember Australia is ""one of the safest places in the world"" to do IVF. ""We have a very high standard. We have a high level of transparency. Our laboratory standards are excellent, and [success] rates very high."" However, she says a less ""fragmented"" legislation and regulation would be helpful moving forward. ""There are more than 40 laws governing fertility treatment in Australia. ""We would like to bring that all together under a national framework."" Dr Hammarberg says while fertility treatment in Australia has ""more regulation and oversight"" than other countries, the publishing of adverse events would be a step forward. ""We do have obligation to report adverse events to the accrediting body, but they don't publish the data."" The accreditation committee haspreviously confirmed this with the ABC. In a statement it said: ""Consistent with other non-government accreditation bodies, [the RTAC] doesn't publicly identify any clinic's audit details"". ""It would also be very helpful to know what a clinic would do to avoid this happening again,"" Dr Hammarberg says. Ms Dickinson says people who work in the fertility industry, whether it be doctors, nurses, embryologists, or counsellors, are taking recent events ""extremely seriously"". ""Everyone I have spoken to is absolutely devastated by these revelations. ""They are conscious this is really affecting people."""
Why it is important to check your super account regularly,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/checking-your-superannuation-account-more-often/105442214,2025-06-25,"When was the last time you checked your superannuation account? If you're struggling to find your most recent statement or remember your login details, you aren't alone. Research commissioned by the Australian Retirement Trust shows four out of every five Australians don't know how much they're putting away for retirement. But experts say there are some good reasons we should be checking in on our retirement savings more regularly. Finance and economics consultant Pauline Taylor says we all receive anannual benefit statementat the end of eachfinancial yearfrom our superannuation fund, which we should ""file away somewhere"". The Melbourne/Naarm-based author says the statement will give you an indication ofhow much super is in your accountandwhether it's growing. ""You look at the amount your employer is putting in under the superannuation guarantee, some extra money you might have put in as a voluntary contribution and the returns on the investments that your super money is invested in,"" she says. Kate McCallum is a financial adviser and author based on Darkinjung lands on the New South Wales Central Coast. She recommendscarrying out a yearly ""super service""(like a car service) to understand taxes, fees and what investment options you're in. ""This is really important because a lot of the defaults are age-based,"" she says. ""So, if you flip over an age category, you may find that you've been automatically moved out of, let's say, a growth portfolio into a balanced and that may not be what you want."" She also recommends checking your super fund'sinvestment management fee. ""You don't see that investment management fee because it's actually taken out of your investment returns,"" she says. ""The average fee is 1 per cent, so if you're paying more than 1 per cent, that's pretty expensive."" Anne Fuchs from the Australian Retirement Trust recommends peopledownload their super fund's app on their phone, in the same way they do for banking apps. ""Four out of five Australians don't know what superannuation they're entitled to, in terms of what is the percentage that their employers have to pay as part of their salary,"" she says. From July 1, Australia's superannuation guarantee rate will increase from 11.5 per cent to 12 per cent.This is the percentage amount of your ordinary earnings that should be paid into your super by your employer. ""This is why it's really important that people pay attention to this compulsory saving that's linked to their wages,"" she says. The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) says the best way to perform a super check iseither on ATO online services through myGovor by contactingyour super fund directly. The ATO says it's important to check your super balance each year to see how much you have and keep track of your employer contributions. ""Your employer should pay your super at least every three months,"" a spokesperson says. ""They may choose to do it more frequently, such as your regular pay cycle."" If you do not receive super contributions or the amounts are incorrect, contact your employer and request an update orreport it to the ATO. In a best-case scenario, money you didn't know you had. If you do a super check through myGov, you might find you have lost or unclaimed super that you can roll into one account. You may have lost track of some of your super when you changed your name, address or job. The ATO says this is why it's important toensure your super fund has your current details. ""Lost super is when your fund has lost touch with you, or your account is inactive,"" a spokesperson says. Kate McCallum says you might also find that you want to change to a fund that has lower fees. To reach a comfortable retirement, here is the estimated super balances needed at certain ages: *Estimated balance viaASFA Super Balance Detective calculator I have always checked my super balance directly through my superannuation fund, but decided to put the myGov check to the test. I had already linked the ATO to my myGov account, so the process was made easier. I was surprised to find that I have two superannuation accounts; however, one wasn't active and had a zero-dollar balance. It also wasn't charging any fees, so I have marked it to follow up and close. During my super check-in also discovered that mydeath beneficiary nominationhad lapsed, and I needed to update it. This wasn't a straightforward process as my fund required me to post a copy of the form, rather than email or update it online. The ATO recommends taking the time to ensure you have a valid death beneficiary nomination in place with your super fund, as this isn't covered by your will. This means your loved ones will not be put through unnecessary difficulties to finalise your estate.Most binding nominations expire every three years. This article contains general information only.

Is it OK to take items from other people's kerbside pick-up?,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/rules-taking-items-from-other-peoples-kerbside-collection/105403918,2025-06-24,"James Straker has been collecting things off the streets since he could drive. ""Having things doesn't make me happy, but finding things does,"" the 53-year-old from Brisbane/Meanjin says. ""Part of the fun is deep diving. A surfboard I found, I learnt all about who that surfboard maker was, contacted him, and asked if he wanted it back. ""I find glass bottles from the early 1900s and research the companies — who they were and what they did."" It means Brisbane City Council's kerbside collection calendar is something James follows closely. But he says there's a certain etiquette to hunting through other people's hard rubbish. The laws around salvaging or taking items that would otherwise be destined for landfill are decided by your local council. The advice in most capital cities is that any junk left on the kerb for council collection is fair game. City of Logan Mayor Jon Raven says council is ""very happy"" for people to take items waiting for kerbside collection. ""People doing scavenging and removing things that can be recycled diverts things from landfill and has an economic impact,"" Cr Raven says. While it's generally accepted that people are welcome to rummage through one another's kerbside collections, Brisbane City Council's chair of city standards Councillor Sarah Hutton says they encourage people to be mindful when doing so. ""While there are no specific regulations around people taking items off the kerb, we do obviously encourage residents to be considerate and respectful. ""[Ensuring] you don't smash anything … or cover the footpath,"" she says for example. Cr Raven says leaving the pile tidy is important, which also helps ""maintain street pride"". While James doesn't ask property owners before taking items, he often ends up chatting to them anyway. ""I really like meeting strangers. ""I've had instances where I go back inside to help someone move more stuff out, and they will say 'My dad has a bunch of records, do you want them?'"" Cr Raven says there are people who supplement their income from travelling around the city collecting items from the kerb to upcycle and sell. One of James's most iconic finds was a book filled with religious stories printed in 1790. ""It was the most beautiful book I've been able to touch,"" he says. ""It was in the back of Kelvin Grove, just sitting in a laundry basket with some other old books. ""I sold it the next day for $300, but it was probably worth more than that."" James says he goes through waves of emotions when he comes across a great find. ""I get upset someone would throw it out, then I get really excited they threw it out. ""Some people just don't see the value in some things."" Cr Raven says the kerbside collection service is especially helpful for those who can't dispose of their own hard rubbish. ""It's sometimes hard when you have units or townhouses … there can be up to three semitrailer loads of waste in the one driveway. ""But often it's the people who live in units who have the most need; they might not have a ute, or are retirees or people with disability."" He says people love the ""egalitarian nature"" of kerbside pick-up. ""Kerbside is available for everybody, whether they are renters or ratepayers — nobody misses out."" Are you good at getting free stuff, or making money from upcycling? We'd love to hear about your best hacks.Share your story here. Acceptable items will vary across Australia, but generally items such as whitegoods, furniture, carpet, rugs and bikes are able to be left out for collection. Most councils won't accept items including hazardous waste, car batteries, bricks and concrete, gas bottles, glass and mirrors. In some areas, including Logan, all items are crushed on the truck and taken to landfill. But Brisbane, for example, has a recycling truck which comes around to select items that can be recycled or sold at in their ""trash and treasure"" type stores, before the clean-up team arrives. Cr Hutton says there have been some amazing items picked up by their teams over the years. ""Pianos … also some vintage furniture, which has gone for top dollar at our treasure trove stores. ""There are a lot of great things that go out on the kerb, and if people can find a second life for these, then great."""
Why this year's Miles Franklin shortlist is the most 'radical' yet,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/miles-franklin-literary-award-2025-shortlist/105435442,2025-06-25,"The shortlist for the 2025 Miles Franklin Literary Award — Australia's most prestigious literary prize — features a dual winner (Michelle de Kretser), two repeat shortlistees (Brian Castro and Fiona McFarlane), and three writers shortlisted for the first time (Julie Janson, Siang Lu and debut author Winnie Dunn). Tim Winton, longlisted for his dystopian cli-fi thriller Juice, missed out on the shortlist and his chance to bag a fifth Miles Franklin award. The shortlist has grownincreasingly diversein recent years, and 2025 is no exception, with five writers of colour in the running for the $60,000 award. Female writers have also dominated the prize in the past decade. If Castro or Lu win, it will be the first time a male author has taken out the award since 2016, when AS Patrić won for his debut novel, Black Rock White City. Last year,Waanyi writer Alexis Wright won for Praiseworthy, an epic novel set in northern Australia that also took out the Stella Prize. This year's winner will be announced on July 24. To take a closer look at the shortlist, we've brought together The Book Show's Claire Nichols and Sarah L'Estrange, The Bookshelf's Kate Evans, and writer and critic Declan Fry. Sarah L'Estrange:Each of the six books investigates race, class and gender in contemporary Australia but in different ways. It's very hard to compare books like Ghost Cities and Dirt Poor Islanders because they're written in such distinct ways, but they both encourage us to think about narrative and who owns stories. Declan Fry:I was surprised to see Highway 13 on the list — it's a short story collection. That's a first, and it could be the most radical thing the Miles Franklin has ever done. I'm here for it — I love to see the definition of the novel always expanding. Claire Nichols:We're getting a novel competition that is moving further from the traditional novel form. DF:Many of these novels are also quite formless. Kate Evans:I like the fact that they're not afraid to include things that are a bit difficult. I thought this shortlist was more interesting than some of the shortlists we've seen recently because they're not all conventional narratives. CN:The list leaves me a little cold. I wanted to see Tim Winton make it. We know he doesn't need another Miles Franklin — he already has four — but I thoughtJuicewas an exciting novel. It was Winton outside his comfort zone, writing a speculative fiction story. There was a great urgency to the writing and a thrilling plot there, too. It felt like a big moment in his writing career. I also wanted to seeThe Burrowmake it. This tiny, perfect novel by Melanie Cheng did so much with so little: one family, a rabbit, COVID and grief. I thought it was a gorgeous piece of traditional novel writing. SL:Perhaps not a traditional Miles Franklin novel, Woo Woo by Ella Baxter is about a woman on the edge and I found it enjoyable and vital. Catherine McKinnon's To Sing of War is another one that didn't even make the longlist — I thought that was a wonderful book. CN:There's been an explosion of own-voices fiction in Australia in the last five to 10 years, and I think Dirt Poor Islanders is up there with the best examples of the genre. SL:It was a pleasure to read. It felt like Ruth Park's Harp in the South for our times, an entrée for most of Australia into this small Tongan Australian community. It's charming, it doesn't pull its punches and, while it might seem like a simple story because it presents as semi-autobiographical, I appreciated the layers as well. DF:It's a very honest book; it has a lot of integrity. One thing I loved was the self-deprecating and ironic humour. There's pathos in it too. Meadow's dreams are limited by the structural constraints on her family's lives. CN:It's a fascinating study of motherhood. The narrator, Meadow, just like Winnie Dunn, lost her mother very young, but in Tongan culture everyone is a mother, so the grandmother and all the aunties are her mother as well. I admired the liveliness of the writing, and I love how tactile it is — you can smell the food, and you can feel the sweat and how crowded that house is in Mount Druitt, full of all those aunties. KE:Theory & Practice starts as one thing, which is an archetypal Australian outsider narrative, and then it ditches that and becomes something else, which is the story of a young woman in the 1980s, immersed in the Melbourne academic world of both theory and practice. This is one I've read twice, and I read it differently the second time. The first time I was struck by the deftness and the humour of it. When I re-read it, I felt like I was reading into other layers of the work. The more you look at it, the more it offers you. SL:I feel like it wore its seriousness heavily, Kate! KE:Oh, you didn't find it funny? SL:I read it asa sad-girl novel— it has all the elements. This one, though, is set in 1980s Melbourne. A woman disaffected is looking back over her life, finding it hard to find her place, having relationships with the wrong men, knowing that she shouldn't be, but still doing it. DF:I didn't care for the interrupted narrative at the beginning, but I did think it was cool that de Kretser has an 'I' who says, 'My novel was failing, so I decided to do something different.' That makes it sound like de Kretser is speaking to us but of course, it's not her, it's an authorial persona. I thought that was clever. CN:And she's put her own picture on the cover of the book! She's playing with the expectations of what we look for in fiction, which I find so fascinating when you compare it to something like Winnie Dunn's book, which is almost straight-up autobiography. There's no veil there for Dunn, but de Kretser is hiding herself in the book. KE:The main character of Chinese Postman lives in the Adelaide Hills. He's alienated people, he loves his dogs, he's telling stories, he's surrounded by piles of books. You could easily make the case that what Castro is doing here is telling stories from his own life and playing around with his identity — he was a postman and he's also Chinese, Portuguese and Jewish, but unlike female writers, male writers aren't generally labelled as autobiographical novelists. DF:I like his debut, Birds of Passage, a lot. It felt the freest of his books. This one is perhaps the most diaristic and fragmented, even though many of them have mixed theory, fiction and biographical elements. KE:That's a warning we should make to readers — this is not a plot-driven novel. It's a novel of ideas. It's one of those books in which nothing happens and everything happens, which I like, but you have to be in the right mode to read it. You can read it like reading James Joyce: start in the middle, read fragments, read it back and forwards. A novel can be hard work and still be worth reading. CN:I'm Team Ghost Cities. I love Australian fiction that surprises you and I like Australian authors who take a big swing, and Siang Lu did that with his first novel, The Whitewash. It was hysterically funny and weird and had something important to say about race in Australia. Ghost Cities is just as experimental and wild, just as silly yet serious. Any book that has a guy who has been fired from his job as a translator because he was using Google Translate and then gets picked up by a film director called Baby Bao to work on a film in a place called Port Man Tou — that is all funny, weird stuff that excites me. There's also this gorgeous romance at the centre of it, which feels very true. There's another section about an ancient Chinese dynasty exploring ideas around art and creation. It's told in this mythic style, and I loved that too. Siang Lu is doing things that no other author in Australia is doing. DF:I have problems with the ending; I don't think he quite sticks the landing. It just ends rather than concluding satisfyingly. SL:It's not an easy read if you don't connect with the fable-like narrative style. You can be left flailing — but there are enough anchors to take you through, and the elements come together like a good puzzle. KE:I love the fact that a competition about showing Australian life in all its aspects includes Chinese cities and multiple identities. DF:I second what Kate says — I want to see more Chinese language in Australian fiction. For many people in the big cities, you hear Mandarin as much as English, and this book is filled with Mandarin. DF:It's lovely to see another small publisher, Magabala Books in particular, on the shortlist. SL:Compassion is a sequel to Julie Janson's 2020 novel, Benevolence, which was about a young Darug woman named Muraging, also called Mary James, growing up in the NSW colony in the 1800s. This book is about her daughter Duringah, or Nellie James, and she's based on Janson's great-great grandmother who showed up in court records over the years for stealing cattle and sheep. CN:Nellie has been a fighter since she was a kid. She's fighting against these men who inflict violence on her and enslave her. What I appreciated about this character was her utter fury and rage about the injustice of the life that she lives. She never settles and she never accepts it, and I found that appealing in a book that is quite confrontational. DF:I think this is the big talking point — how did a short story collection get onto the shortlist? KE:I read it as a novel. Each story addresses the same subject in an interestingly lateral way — this serial killer based on Ivan Milat, but McFarlane gives him a different name, Paul Biga. I like the way it explores the repercussions of a terrible event without just focusing on the families of victims or the cops, although they're in there as well. She also manages to slide in questions about the ethics of crime and true crime, which is so problematic. SL:I appreciated her agility as a writer to go from one set of characters and leap to another to create this portrait around a central figure who's never present. Like with Ghost Cities, you're trying to put the puzzle together. In each of the stories, you're primed as a reader: you're thinking, 'How does this relate to the crime? What are the connections?' And you have to stick with it to get the reward of working out what the connection is, even if it's very tenuous. DF:Fiona McFarlane's a lovely stylist. The prose is consistently very strong and I like how she plays with form. SL:I'd be happy if Highway 13 or Dirt Poor Islanders won. DF:My favourite was Theory & Practice, but Dirt Poor Islanders would be my left-field pick. CN:Michelle de Kretser has alreadywon the Stella Prize this year— I don't think we want to see another calendar year where we have the same winner of both the Stella and the Miles Franklin. I'd love to see the wealth spread around. I'm going for Ghost Cities — I don't think it's a perfect book, but I love its ambition and that it's different and fun on what is a somewhat stodgy list. KE:I'll say Highway 13 for the win. It's a book that throws the form up in the air."
Lewis Hamilton produced the F1 movie. So why does it handle race so poorly?,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-25/brad-pitt-f1-the-movie-review-thrilling-and-unrealistic/105454548,2025-06-25,"F1: The Movie was always going to struggle to set itself apart from the runaway hit Netflix series Formula 1: Drive to Survive. What: A middle-aged driver's improbable comeback to the elite world of F1 racing. Starring: Brad Pitt and Damson Idris Directed by:Joseph Kosinski When: In cinemas now Likely to make you feel: Pumped with adrenaline, but disappointed The multi-season reality TV show has been following F1 drivers, team managers and owners on and off the race track for seven seasons, elevating drivers to global stardom and introducing the sport to new, diverse audiences. And theviewers have been lapping it up. This perhaps explains the film's ludicrous plot. F1 stars Brad Pitt as Sonny Hayes, a middle-aged, washed up driver who retired from the limelight after a near-fatal crash at the Spanish Grand Prix 30 years ago. He now spends his days filling in at a hodgepodge of motorsport competitions — from the 24 Hours of Daytona race in the US to the Baja 100 in Mexico. Some call him a has-been. Others think he's a never-was. Enter Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), owner of the fictional Expensify APX GP F1 team and Sonny's former teammate. APX GP hasn't scored a single point for the past two-and-a-half seasons and they're in desperate need of a lead driver to mentor their second: impatient rookie Joshua Pearce (played by a delightfully cheeky Damson Idris). Mid-season and with few other options, Ruben begs Sonny to take the role. Cue an intense rivalry between Joshua and Sonny, who clash over their age gap, racing strategies, attitudes and everything in between. Joshua is young, Black, British and so desperate for a long-term career in a sport that's historically been the playground of the white and elite that he's happy to function as a walking advertisement and do everything by the book. Despite the overconfidence he projects, he still has a lot to learn. Sonny is an achingly American older hunk of a white man who swans around in rose-tinted glasses with little awareness of his privilege and too much charm for his own good. He refuses to play the PR game or follow any rules, and his idea of race preparation involves donning a lucky pair of odd socks. And yet, with Sonny on board and just a few tweaks to their cars, APX GP somehow manages to turn themselves into real contenders in a handful of races. To say this is implausible is putting it lightly. But especially considering that a big part of APX GP's new-found success comes down to Sonny's ""race strategies"", which would better be described as dangerous race manipulation that in real life would more likely result in life-threatening injuries and penalties than podiums. It's surprising a movie produced by none other than seven-time F1 World Champion Lewis Hamilton takes so many liberties in depicting the sport. The narrative opportunities the F1 movie fumbles are similarly disappointing. You'd expect Sonny to have some kind of trauma to work through from his near-death experience driving an F1 car 30 years ago, but no. He's apparently fine to resume racing as if nothing ever happened. When Joshua faces a similarly horrifying crash, he too carries on racing with little fanfare. And while the F1 movie features an impressively diverse cast, it frequently does its marginalised characters a disservice. There's the time the only woman on the APX GP pit crew makes a crucial error at a pit stop. There's Kate McKenna (Kerry Condon), who may be the first woman to serve as APX GP's technical director, but the bulk of her storyline involves her breaking her ""no sleeping with co-workers"" rule for a certain driver. And when Joshua, a second-generation immigrant, points out he's had to work twice as hard to get where he is, Sonny quips that he only deserves a meaningless participation trophy. But what the F1 movie lacks in a plausible narrative and depth, it makes up for in its sleek original score from the inimitable Hans Zimmer, and undeniably thrilling driving sequences. Director Joseph Kosinski, the man behind Top Gun: Maverick, is unsurprisingly adept at making viewers feel as if they are the ones in the cockpit, and this film has the bonus of being filmed on real circuits during race weekends — from Silverstone in the UK to Monza in Italy. The F1 movie is at its best when realistically blurring fiction with reality. There are countless cameos throughout this film, from Red Bull's reigning world champion driver, Max Verstappen, to Mercedes chief executive Toto Wolff and prominent F1 commentator and journalist Will Buxton. A biopic looking at Hamilton's journey to F1 and subsequent super stardom would have likely meant more to the fans and had something of note to say — beyond ageism being 'bad' and feeling the fear and doing things anyway being 'good'. But as a fictionalised version of Drive to Survive that requires total suspension of disbelief, F1 is serviceable. Particularly for F1 fans who are into cameos, newcomers who don't care about plausibility … and people who simply want to ogle 61-year-old Pitt shirtless,physical abuse allegations and all. F1 is in cinemas now."
Aussie director says Trump is pulling from the Bjelke-Petersen playbook,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2025-06-24/joh-bjelke-petersen-last-king-of-queensland/105452784,2025-06-24,"Upon learning the results of the 2024 US election, Australian director Kriv Stenders was ""pumping the air"", but not for the obvious reason. What: An eerily timely look back at the chaos and carnage of Joh Bjelke-Petersen's near-20-year reign as premier of Queensland. Starring: Richard Roxburgh Directed by:Kriv Stenders. When: Streaming on Stan now Likely to make you feel: like this is all very familiar... The born-and-bred Queenslander wasn't looking forward to the promised chaos of a second Donald Trump term. But he was excited about what it meant for his latest project, Joh: Last King of Queensland. The film tracks the industrious rise and spectacular fall of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the controversial premier who ruled the state from 1968 to 1987 before being ousted from office following the exposure of widespread corruption within his government. Through a range of voices — from Indigenous activist and poet Lionel Fogarty, to Nationals leader David Littleproud, to Bjelke-Petersen's own children — Stenders pieces together a vision of one of Australia's most divisive political figures. And while, for some, Bjelke-Petersen is a distant memory in Australia's political history, Stenders says there's never been a better time to revisit the past. ""The film is a cautionary tale really, saying, 'Just be aware that you know this has happened before and it could happen again,'"" he told ABC Entertainment. Raised in a farming family in Kingaroy, north-west of Brisbane, Bjelke-Petersen entered politics as the Member for Nanango in1947. Steadily climbing the ladder within what was then known as the Country Party, he was voted in as premier of Queensland by 1968. A child of 60s Queensland, Stenders came of age knowing nothing but the business-forward, conservative values of the Bjelke-Petersen government. ""My childhood and my early adult life were kind of basically lived under Joh's shadow. As I got older, especially as I became a teenager, I realised that it was actually an oppressive regime,"" he told ABC Entertainment. While crowing about his fierce protection of Queenslanders from the ills of socialism, poker machines and rude movies, Bjelke-Petersen prioritised the state's economic growth above all else. He held onto power through electoral gerrymandering and wielded a corrupt police force like a weapon against dissenters. While he might have excelled at boosting business, his quest for total power came at the cost of Indigenous and democratic rights, as well as Queenslanders' civil liberties. In 1971, he declared a state of emergency to clamp down on anti-apartheid protests around the South African Springboks'rugby union tour. When his directives were ignored by demonstrators, he unleashed dozens of police officers on the public, ending in bashed heads and broken bones. By 1977, his government had rushed through an amendment to the The Traffic Act that effectively banned street protests, unless you could procure a very rare permit from then-police commissionerTerry Lewis, who was later jailed for corruption. As Bjelke-Petersen declared: ""Protest marches are a thing of the past."" ""The oppressiveness of Joh's police state was really quite scary,"" Stenders says. ""It was a way of threatening and controlling the populace."" But for Stenders, who was already deep into the Brisbane music scene and would eventually direct the music videos for sunshine state icons The Go-Betweens, there was a silver lining: the local punk scene was thriving. The political climate inspired bands like The Saints and The Parameters. The latter's 1983 single'Pig City'— itself a rallying cry against the police corruption within Bjelke-Petersen's government — is featured in the documentary. ""[Music] was a form of activism. It was a really exciting time, there was something to rail against, there was something to fight against,"" Stenders says. ""Brisbane was a bit of a wasteland back then; in a funny kind of way, the artistic community was closer and stronger because of it."" By the late 80s, following a disastrous tilt at prime minister — which ended in a messy (and temporary)federal Coalition party split— Bjelke-Petersen's actions were catching up with him. Between December 1986 and January 1987, Brisbane's Courier-Mail published articles reporting around 20 illegal brothels were operating in the Fortitude Valley area of Brisbane, apparently unchallenged by police. On May 11, 1987 aFour Corners reportrevealed that police in Brisbane had been ignoring and even condoning illegal gambling, organised prostitution and drug trafficking, with some taking payments of up to $100,000. A day later, an independent judicial inquiry into the allegations that senior police were being paid to protect organised crime was announced — later known as the Fitzgerald inquiry. As the inquiry began to link the corruption back to his government, Bjelke-Petersen announced he would resign on August 8, 1988: the 20th anniversary of his swearing in as premier. But, by November 1987, the National Country Party leadership had spilled, ousting the once-powerful premier who refused to leave his office to facethe press, Parliament or even his own party. To get into the mind frame of Bjelke-Petersen in his final days, Stenders reached out to Australian actor Richard Roxburgh to embody the then-disgraced politician through arresting deliveries of Bjelke-Petersen's own speeches. The director was fixated on the concept of a defeated but still fighting Bjelke-Petersen in the last days of his ""power"", preaching his accomplishments to an empty room. ""I thought, 'Let's all sit around his last three days in office, barricading himself in like Hitler, basically reflecting on his life.' That mechanism just unlocked the film for me."" Roxburgh, who recently worked with Stenders on political drama The Correspondent, dived head first into an ""enormous amount of documentary footage"" to capture Bjelke-Petersen's mannerisms, taking care to never fall into parody (Gerry Connollyalready had that bit on lock, anyway). ""Anytime you play a character, no matter what the kind of public evaluations of that person, you have to find the things that that person believed so deeply in,"" Roxburgh told ABC Entertainment. ""With Joh, he was deeply religious. Yet there was a side of him that could go down these kinds of darker corridors that we learn about. ""It's finding the checks and balances that he had with his own psychology, the way that he could justify a lot of the things he did within the frame of his religious belief and his absolute certainty."" ""He was a politician but he was a human being,"" Stenders agrees. ""It is very easy to categorise him as a monster or as a clown, but that's dangerous because it gives them the remit to not act like human beings."" It's been almost 40 years since Bjelke-Petersen was in power, and20 years since he died, aged 94. But Stenders says there's never been a more pertinent time to rediscover the red flags from throughout his reign. ""The big elephant in the room is obviously Trump,"" he says. ""Trump is a populist leader that very much has drawn exactly from Joh's playbook in everything that he did in terms of his manipulation of the media, his use of force, even to the point where he refused to leave office."" One of the catalysts for Stenders taking on King of Queensland was his firm belief that, in order to change power, first you must understand it. ""The film was really an attempt to unlock the enigma of Joh and to say, 'Hey, listen. We actually did have a Trump here.' This is actually also within our capability, this is within our bandwidth of creating this kind of leader,"" he says. In regards to LGBTQIA+ rights, Indigenous rights and abortion access, Stenders says the ""ghost"" of Bjelke-Petersen is still alive today. ""Joh may be dead and buried, but his influence is certainly still being felt on a weekly, monthly level in Australian politics."" Revealed - Joh: Last King Of Queensland is streaming on Stan now."
